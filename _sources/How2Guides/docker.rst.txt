Running MetPX via Docker
------------------------


Introduction
------------

While Sarracenia can be installed via pip, debian/Ubuntu, a `Docker`_ capability
is also provided in support of "run anywhere" containerization and cloud
native environments.

To provide maximum flexibility, Sarracenia's default image does not include
a broker or an entrypoint.  It is up to the user to further orchestrate their
deployment accordingly.  `Docker Compose`_ is one such orchestration capability.

Below are various workflows to build, orchestrate and run sarracenia via Docker::

  # clone repo
  git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia.git
  cd sarracenia

  # build image
  docker build -t metpx-sr3:latest .

  # sarracenia connected to a rabbitmq setup
  # start
  docker-compose -f docker/compose/pump/docker-compose.yml up
  # stop
  docker-compose -f docker/compose/pump/docker-compose.yml down

Logging
-------

Norms in the docker world are to send messages to standard output, so
the option *logStdout* should be used in any configurations in a docker container.
This will make *docker logs* work as expected in a docker environment, by printing
to standard output.
