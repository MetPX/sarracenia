Description: v3 Directory mirroring in real-time for users, file servers and web sites.
 Part of the Meteorological Product Exchanger project, Sarracenia publishes
 advertisement messages to an AMQP broker containing URLS of files in real-time.
 Others consume the advertisments and download the files quickly.   
 The first public server for this is: http://dd.weather.gc.ca 
 Several other non-public instances deployed.
 Both products and directories are user configurable.
