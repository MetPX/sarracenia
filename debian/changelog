  * Corrected that *inflight* option was NONE on sender.  It was documented and intended to be '.tmp'.
    now it defaults to '.tmp' but if there is a post_broker, it defaults to NONE.
  * added info messages for cases where msg_received, but the log does not say what happenned (rename/link/mv cases.)
  * times used to be truncated to milliseconds, now the natural number of places after the decimal are retained.
  * C: fix: mv called from shim where no directory in old file name caused malformed *oldname* field in resulting post.
  * C: fix: segfault if credentials.conf is missing.
