TO COMPLETE :  In addition to *thneed* work.  other small things.

ALREADY FIXED !!!:
=================

      - fix: force-polling broken since recent libsrshim work.
      -- delete support to sr_Watch in polling mode (already in sr_cpost.)

Remove:
=======

 * DONE

   remove 'filename' in msg.headers  *** impacts people used to topic exp and topic v00
   remove 'flow' option and in msg.headers
   remove 'recursive'  and set it to True when applicable


 * AS DISCUSSED... *rename*  kept   sr_watch users using -skip force headers[rename] to stripped relpath

   *rename* functionality should be removed, as it is not used in practice.
   there was rename has a message header, and rename as an additional field on messages.
   both should be removed.  Should we iterate the version of version2 protocol?


Addition:
========


 * DONE

            CAVEAT: options should be set after the plugin declaration
                    if not options go through the extend mechanism

         -- variable definition for plugins.  A way to declare variables to avoid the 'unknown setting' error message.
            in __init__ in each plugins something like.

                self.declare_option( "message_threshold" )

            just declares the option so that know unknown message is generated...



 * DONE    ~/.cache/sarra/"host"/log
           ~/.cache/sarra/"host"/subscribe/...

           *statehost* option.  To include the hostname in the logfile names,recent_files, etc... all state files.
                      values:   Off|on|short|fqdn

                     default off,  on== short,   fqdn=Fully qualified domain name.


   
 * POSTPONED

           Efficient file truncation support:
 
              to transmit a truncation...
              -- if new file is shorter than old file.
              -- calculate checksum of old file upto the length of the new file.
              -- if they match, then truncate file and done.

   
 * IF TIME


     Consolidate: sr_watch and sr_post -> sr_post.
          the only difference should be that post becomes a watch, then sleep > 0.

   
 * TO FINISH

 post_base_dir
 post_base_url
 etc...


 * TO DO

additional *actions* component x::

  start|stop            if no configs specified, then start all of x


  sr_subscribe add new.conf  mine.inc
          -> copies new.conf & mine.inc -> ~/.config/sarra/subscribe/new.conf


  add/remove        Add a config file by copying it from wherever to the right place.

  edit                     call up $EDITOR on the config file.

  log                      exec tail -f of the log file of the config file...
                          if instances >1  warn monitoring is easier with sr_report.
                          if an instance is specified, then tail -f of that instance's log

  list                      list all the files in the component's config directory.
     sr_subscribe
              new (enabled) instances: 5
       includes:
               mine.inc
  enable/disable     rename config file from .conf to .off
                     if disable and running... warn and dont do

In addition to *thneed* work.  other small things.

- fix: force-polling broken since recent libsrshim work.


Remove:

 - 'flow' option should be removed, *header* has replaced it's function.

 - 'recursive' ... I think it is just always true.

 - *rename* functionality should be removed, as it is not used in practice.
   there was rename has a message header, and rename as an additional field on messages.
   both should be removed.  Should we iterate the version of version2 protocol?

 - 'filename' in msg.headers


Add:

  -- variable definition for plugins.  A way to declare variables to avoid the 'unknown setting' error message.
     in __init__ in each plugins something like.

         self.declare_option( "message_threshold" )
