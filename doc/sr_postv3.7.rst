STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
--------------------

Sarracenia version 2 messages are the current standard, used for terabytes
and millions of files per day of transfers. Version 3 is a proposal for a next
iteration of Sarracenia messages, but it is not fully implemented, and 
not in use anywhere, and may never be used. It is also not frozen yet
and subject to change.

Most fields and their meaning is the same in version 3 as it was in version 2. 
Some fields are changing as the protocol is exposed to wider review than previously.
It is implementing changes the `World Meteorological Organization <www.wmo.int>`_
for use in a renewed `WIS/Global Telecommunications System <http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WIS/>`_
This format will track work done in the `WMO mesh <https://www.github.com/MetPX/wmo_mesh>`_

The change in payload protocol is targetted at simplifying future implementations
and enabling use by messaging protocols other than pre-1.0 AMQP.
See `Changes from v02`_ for more details.

To generate messages in v03 format, use following setting::

  post_topic_prefix v03.post

To select messages to consume in that format::

  topic_prefix v03.post



SYNOPSIS
--------


Version 03 format of file change announcements for sr_post.  

An sr_post message consists of a topic, and the *BODY* 

**AMQP Topic:** *<version>.[post|report].{<dir>.}*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

           <version> = "v03" the version of the protocol or format.
           "post" = the type of message within the protocol.
           <dir> = a sub-directory leading to the file (perhaps many directories deep)

**BODY:** *{ <headers> }* (JSON encoding.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The headers are an array of name:value pairs::

  MANDATORY:

          "pubTime"       - YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.ss - UTC date/timestamp.
          "baseUrl"       - root of the url to download.
          "relPath"       - relative path can be catenated to <base_url>
          "identity"     - WMO version of v02 sum field, under development.
          {
             "method" : "md5" | "sha512" | "md5name" | "link" | "remove" | "cod" | "random" ,
             "value"  : "base64 encoded checksum value"
          }
    one of:

          "identity"     - for changes in file contents, an identity checksum.
          {
             "method" : "md5" | "sha512" | "cod" | "random" ,
             "value"  : "base64 encoded checksum value"
          }
    or:
          "fileOp"   - to describe non-data file update operations.
          {            
             "link" : "symbolic link value (target) string"
             "remove" : ""     - flag present when removing a file (argument ignored.)
             "hlink" : "hardlink value string (file being linked to.)"
             "rename" : "name of file before rename."
          }
    or:
         nothing... If neither of these is present, 

         the md5sum will be assumed and used to perform duplicate suppression.


  OPTIONAL:

          "size"          - the number of bytes being advertised.
          "blocks"        - if the file being advertised is partitioned, then:
          {
              "method"    : "inplace" | "partitioned" , - is the file already in parts?
              "size"      : "9999", - size of the blocks.
              "count"     : "9999", - number of blocks in the file.
              "remainder" : "9999", - the size of the last block.
              "number"    : "9999", - which block is this.
          }
          "rename"        - name to write file locally.
          "topic"         - copy of topic from AMQP header (usually omitted)
          "source"        - the originating entity of the message. 
          "from_cluster"  - the originating cluster of a message.
          "to_clusters"   - a destination specification.
          "link"          - value of a symbolic link. (if sum starts with L)
          "atime"         - last access time of a file (optional)
          "mtime"         - last modification time of a file (optional)
          "mode"          - permission bits (optional)

          "content"       - for smaller files, the content may be embedded.
          {
              "encoding" : "utf-8" | "base64"  , 
              "value"    " "encoded file content"
          }

          For "v03.report" topic messages the following addtional
          headers will be present:
  
          "report"   - status report field documented in `Report Messages`_
          "message"  - status report message documented in `Report Messages`_

          additional user defined name:value pairs are permitted.

NOTE:
     The **parts** header has not yet been reviewed by others. We started on the discussion of *size*,
     but there was no conclusion.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Sources create messages in the *sr_post* format to announce file changes. Subscribers 
read the post to decide whether a download of the content being announced is warranted.  This 
manual page completely describes the format of those messages.  The messages are payloads 
for an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) message bus, but file data transport 
is separate, using more common protocols such as SFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP (or other?).
Files are transported as pure byte streams, no metadata beyond the file contents is 
transported (permission bits, extended attributes, etc...). Permissions of files 
on the destination system are upto the receiver to decide.

With this method, AMQP messages provide a 'control plane' for data transfers.  While each post message 
is essentially point to point, data pumps can be transitively linked together to make arbitrary 
networks.  Each posting is consumed by the next hop in the chain. Each hop re-advertises 
(creates a new post for) the data for later hops.  The posts flow in the same direction as the 
data.  If consumers permit it, report messages (see sr_report(7)) also flow through the control path, 
but in the opposite direction, allowing sources to know the entire disposition of their 
files through a network.  

The minimal layer over raw AMQP provides more complete file transfer functionality:

Source Filtering (use of TOPIC_ exchanges)
   The messages make use of *topic exchanges* from AMQP, where topics are hierarchies
   meant to represent subjects of interest to a consumer. A consumer may upload the 
   selection criteria to the broker so that only a small subset of postings
   are forwarded to the client.  When there are many users interested in only 
   small subsets of data, the savings in traffic are large.

Fingerprint Winnowing (use of the identity_ header)
   Each product has an identity fingerprint and size intended to identify it uniquely, 
   referred to as a *fingerprint*. If two files have the same fingerprint, they 
   are considered equivalent. In cases where multiple sources of equivalent data are 
   available but downstream consumers would prefer to receive single announcements
   of files, intermediate processes may elect to publish notifications of the first 
   product with a given fingerprint, and ignore subsequent ones. 
   Propagating only the first occurrence of a datum received downstream, based on
   its fingerprint, is termed: *Fingerprint Winnowing*.

   *Fingerprint Winnowing* is the basis for a robust strategy for high availability: setting up
   multiple sources for the same data, consumers accept announcements from all of them, but only
   forwarding the first one received downstream. In normal operation, one source may be faster 
   than the others, and so the other sources' files are usually 'winnowed'. When one source
   disappears, the other sources' data is automatically selected, as the fingerprints
   are now *fresh* and used, until a faster source becomes available.

   The advantage of this method for high availability is that no A/B decision is required.
   The time to *switchover* is zero. Other strategies are subject to considerable delays
   in making the decision to switchover, and pathologies one could summarize as flapping,
   and/or deadlocks.  

   *Fingerprint Winnowing* also permits *mesh-like*, or *any to any* networks, where one simply 
   interconnects a node with others, and messages propagate. Their specific path through the 
   network is not defined, but each participant will download each new datum from the first
   node that makes it available to them. Keeping the messages small and separate from data 
   is optimal for this usage.
 
Partitioning (use of the parts_ Header)
   In any store and forward data pumping network that transports entire files limits the maximum
   file size to the minimum available on any intervening node. To avoid defining a maximum 
   file size, a segmentation standard is specified, allowing intervening nodes to hold
   only segments of the file, and forward them as they are received, rather than being
   forced to hold the entire file.

   Partitioning also permits multiple streams to transfer portions of the file in parallel. 
   Multiple streams can provide an effective optimization over long links.

   

TOPIC
-----

In topic based AMQP exchanges, every message has a topic header. AMQP defines the '.' character 
as a hierarchical separator (like '\' in a windows path name, or '/' on linux) there is also a 
pair of wildcards defined by the standard:  '*' matches a single topic, '#' matches the rest of 
the topic string. To allow for changes in the message body in the future, topic trees begin with 
the version number of the protocol.   

AMQP allows server side topic filtering using wildcards. Subscribers specify topics of 
interest (which correspond to directories on the server), allowing them to pare down the 
number of notifications sent from server to client.  

The root of the topic tree is the version specifier: "v03".  Next comes the message type specifier.  
These two fields define the protocol that is in use for the rest of the message.
The message type for post messages is "post".  After the fixed topic prefix, 
the remaining sub-topics are the path elements of the file on the web server.  
For example, if a file is placed on http://www.example.com/a/b/c/d/foo.txt, 
then the complete topic of the message will be:  *v03.post.a.b.c.d*
AMQP fields are limited to 255 characters, and the characters in the field are utf8 
encoded, so actual length limit may be less than that. 

note::

  Sarracenia relies on brokers to interpret the topic header. Brokers interpret protocol
  specific headers *AMQP), and will not efficiently decode the payload to extract headers. 
  Therefore the topic header is stored in an AMQP header, rather than the payload to permit
  server-side filtering. To avoid sending the same information twice, this header is
  omitted from the JSON payload.

  Many client-side implementation will, once the message is loaded, set the *topic* header 
  in the in-memory structure, so it would be very unwise to to set the *topic* header
  in an application even though it isn't visible in the on-wire payload.


Mapping to MQTT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One goal of v03 format is to have a payload format that works with more than just AMQP.
Message Queing Telemetry Transport (MQTT v3.11) is an iso standard ( https://www.iso.org/standard/69466.html 
protocol that can easily support the same pub/sub messaging pattern, but a few details
differ, so a mapping is needed.

Firstly, the topic separate in MQTT is a forward slash (/), instead of the period (.) used in AMQP.

Second, with AMQP, one can establish separate topic hierarchies using *topic-based exchanges*. 
MQTT has no similar concept, there is simply one hierarchy, so when mapping, place the exchange
name at the root of the topic hierarchy to achieve the same effect::

  AMQP:   Exchange: <exchange name> 
             topic: v03.post.<directory>...

  MQTT:   topic: <exchange name>/v03/post/<directory>...



THE FIXED HEADERS
-----------------

The message is a single JSON encoded array, with a mandatory set of fields, while allowing
for use of arbitrary other fields.  Mandatory fields must be present in every message, and

 * "pubTime" : "*<date stamp>*" : the publication date the posting was emitted.  Format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS. *<decimalseconds>*

 Note: The datestamp is always in the UTC timezone.

 * "baseUrl" : "<*base_url*>" -- the base URL used to retrieve the data.

 * "relPath" : "<*relativepath*>" --  the variable part of the URL, usually appended to *baseUrl*.

The URL consumers will use to download the data. Example of a complete URL::

 sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver/data/NRPDS/outputs/NRPDS_HiRes_000.gif


Additional fields:

**from_cluster=<cluster_name>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The from_cluster header defines the name of the source cluster where the 
   data was introduced into the network. It is used to return the logs back 
   to the cluster whenever its products are used.

**link=<value of symbolic link>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When file to transfer is a symbolic link, the 'link' header is created to 
   contain its value.

**Parts**
~~~~~~~~~
.. _parts:

v02: **parts=<method>,<bsz>,<blktot>,<brem>,<bno>**

v03::
     "size":<sz> , 

     "blocks" : 
     { 
            "method": "inplace" or "partitioned", 
            "size": <bsz>,
            "count": <blktot>,
            "remainder": <brem>,
            "number": <bno>
     }

 A header indicating the method and parameters for partitioning applied for the file.
 Partitioning is used to send a single file as a collection of segments, rather than as
 a single entity.  Partitioning is used to accelerate transfers of large data sets by using
 multiple streams, and/or to reduce storage use for extremely large files.

 When transferring partitioned files, each partition is advertised and potentially transported
 independently across a data pumping network.

 *<method>*
 
 Indicates what partitioning method, if any, was used in transmission. 

 +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |   Method        | Description                                                         |
 +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | p - partitioned | File is partitioned, individual part files are created.             |
 +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | i - inplace     | File is partitioned, but blocks are read from a single file,        |
 |                 | rather than parts.                                                  |
 +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | 1 - <sizeonly>  | File is in a single part (no partitioning).                         |
 |                 | in v03, only *size* header will be present. *blocks* is omitted     |
 +-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

 - analogous to rsync options: --inplace, --partial,

 *<blocksize in bytes>: bsz*

 The number of bytes in a block.  When using method 1, the size of the block is the size of the file.  
 Remaining fields only useful for partitioned files.	

 *<blocks in total>: blktot*
 the integer total number of blocks in the file (last block may be partial)

 *<remainder>: brem*
 normally 0, on the last block, remaining bytes in the file
 to transfer.

        -- if (fzb=1 and brem=0)
               then bsz=fsz in bytes in bytes.
               -- entire files replaced.
               -- this is the same as rsync's --whole-file mode.

 *<block#>: bno*
 0 origin, the block number covered by this posting.


**rename=<relpath>** 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The relative path from the current directory in which to place the file.

**oldname=<path>** / **newname=<path>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 when a file is renamed at the source, to send it to subscribers, two posts 
 result: one message is announced with the new name as the base_url, 
 and the oldname header set to the previous file name.
 Another message is sent with the old name as the src path, and the *newname* 
 as a header.  This ensures that *accept/reject* clauses are correctly
 interpreted, as a *rename* may result in a download if the former name
 matches a *reject*  clause, or a file removal if the new name
 matches a *reject* clause.

 Hard links are also handled as an ordinary post of the file with a *oldname*
 header set.

**source=<sourceid>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 a character field indicating the source of the data injected into the network.
 should be unique within a data pumping network.  It's usually the same as the
 account used to authenticate to the broker.

.. _sum:

**sum=<method>,<value>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


 The sum is a v02 signature computed to allow receivers to determine 
 if they have already downloaded the partition from elsewhere.

   *<method>* - character field indicating the checksum algorithm used.

 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  Method        | Description                                                         |
 |  v02 - v03     |                                                                     |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  0 - random    | No checksums (unconditional copy.) Skips reading file (faster)      |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  a - arbitrary | arbitrary, application defined value which cannot be calculated     |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  d - md5       | Checksum the entire data (MD-5 as per IETF RFC 1321)                |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  L - link      | Linked: SHA512 sum of link value                                    |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  n - md5name   | Checksum the file name (MD-5 as per IETF RFC 1321)                  |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  R - remove    | Removed: SHA512 of file name.                                       |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  s - sha512    | Checksum the entire data (SHA512 as per IETF RFC 6234)              |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  z - cod       | Checksum on download, with algorithm as argument                    |
 |                | Example:  z,d means download, applying d checksum, and advertise    |
 |                | with that calculated checksum when propagating further.             |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  *<name>*      | Checksum with some other algorithm, named *<name>*                  |
 |                | *<name>* should be *registered* in the data pumping network.        |
 |                | Registered means that all downstream subscribers can obtain the     |
 |                | algorithm to validate the checksum.                                 |
 +----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+


*<value>* The value is computed by applying the given method to the partition being transferred.
  for algorithms for which no value makes sense, a random integer is generated to support
  checksum based load balancing.

**identity**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Is a v03 version of the sum field made more explicit. For example::

   "sum" : "d,hexsumvalue"    ---> "identity" : { "method":"md5", "value":"base64sumvalue"  }

 This is partially supported for now (produce but do not consume.) The change in name
 is also motivated by the intent to use add digital signatures to list of known algorithms.
 there is a change in encoding from hex to base64 for compactness' sake.
 As the values for cod and zero sums are not encoded, they are the same in both v02 and v03.

**to_clusters=<cluster_name1,cluster_name2,...>**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The to_clusters defines a list of destination clusters where the data should go into the network.
 Each name should be unique within all exchanging rabbitmq clusters. It is used to do the transit
 of the products and their notices through the exchanging clusters.

**"topic": v03.post.<relpath without filename>** ( RESERVED )
 The topic header is not present in the JSON payload of the message. It is instead stored
 in a protocol specific header (AMQP HEADER.) when an application reads the AMQP header
 into memory, it will typically add this to the in-memory structure.

Report Messages
---------------

Some clients may return telemetry to the origin of downloaded data for troubleshooting
and statistical purposes. Such messages, have the *v03.report* topic, and have a *report*
header which is a JSON *object* with four fields:

 { "elapsedTime": <report_time>, "resultCode": <report_code>, "host": <report_host>, "user": <report_user>* }

 * *<report_code>*  result codes describe in the next session

 * *<report_time>*  time the report was generated.

 * *<report_host>*  hostname from which the retrieval was initiated.

 * *<report_user>*  broker username from which the retrieval was initiated.


Report messages should never include the *content* header (no file embedding in reports.)


Report_Code
~~~~~~~~~~~

The report code is a three digit status code, adopted from the HTTP protocol (w3.org/IETF RFC 2616)
encoded as text.  As per the RFC, any code returned should be interpreted as follows:

	* 2xx indicates successful completion,
	* 3xx indicates further action is required to complete the operation.
	* 4xx indicates a permanent error on the client prevented a successful operation.
	* 5xx indicates a problem on the server prevented successful operation.

.. NOTE::
   FIXME: need to validate whether our use of error codes co-incides with the general intent
   expressed above... does a 3xx mean we expect the client to do something? does 5xx mean
   that the failure was on the broker/server side?

The specific error codes returned, and their meanings are implementation-dependent.
For the sarracenia implementation, the following codes are defined:

+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Code   | Corresponding text and meaning for sarracenia implementation                               |

Other Report Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


*<report_message>* a string.





Optional Headers
----------------

for the file mirroring use case, additional headers will be present:

**atime,mtime,mode**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  man 2 stat - the linux/unix standard file metadata:
  access time, modification time, and permission (mode bits)
  the times are in the same date format as the pubTime field.
  the permission string is four characters intended to be interpreted as
  traditional octal linux/unix permissions.


**Headers which are unknown to a given broker MUST be forwarded without modification.**

Sarracenia provides a mechanism for users to include arbitrary other headers in
messages, to amplify metadata for more detailed decision making about downloading data.
For example::

  "PRINTER" : "name_of_corporate_printer",

  "GeograpicBoundingBox" : 
   { 
           "top_left" : { "lat": 40.73, "lon": -74.1 } , 
           "bottom_right": { "lat": -40.01, "lon": -71.12 } 
   }

would permit the client to apply more elaborate and precise client side filtering,
and/or processing. Intervening implementation may know nothing about the header, 
but they should not be stripped, as some consumers may understand and process them.


EXAMPLE
-------

:: 

 AMQP TOPIC: v03.post.NRDPS.GIF
 MQTT TOPIC: exchange/v03/post/NRDPS/GIF/
 Body: { "pubTime": "201506011357.345", "baseUrl": "sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver", "relPath": "/data/NRPDS/outputs/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif",
    "rename": "NRDPS/GIF/", "parts":"p,457,1,0,0", "identity" : { "method":"md5", "value":"<md5sum-base64>" }, "source": "ec_cmc" }

        - v03 - version of protocol
        - post - indicates the type of message
        - version and type together determine format of following topics and the message body.

        - blocksize is 457  (== file size)
        - block count is 1
        - remainder is 0.
        - block number is 0.
        - d - checksum was calculated on the body of the file.
        - complete source URL specified (does not end in '/')
        - relative path specified for

        pull from:
                sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver/data/NRPDS/outputs/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif

        complete relative download path:
                NRDPS/GIF/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif

                -- takes file name from base_url.
                -- may be modified by validation process.


Another example
---------------

The post resulting from the following sr_watch command, noticing creation of the file 'foo'::

 sr_watch -pbu sftp://stanley@mysftpserver.com/ -path /data/shared/products/foo -pb amqp://broker.com

Here, *sr_watch* checks if the file /data/shared/products/foo is modified.
When it happens, *sr_watch*  reads the file /data/shared/products/foo and calculates its checksum.
It then builds a post message, logs into broker.com as user 'guest' (default credentials)
and sends the post to defaults vhost '/' and exchange 'sx_guest' (default exchange).

A subscriber can download the file /data/shared/products/foo  by logging in as user stanley
on mysftpserver.com using the sftp protocol to  broker.com assuming he has proper credentials.

The output of the command is as follows ::

  AMQP Topic: v03.post.20150813.data.shared.products
  MQTT Topic: <exchange>/v03/post/20150813/data/shared/products
  Body: { "pubTime":"20150813T161959.854", "baseUrl":"sftp://stanley@mysftpserver.com/", 
          "relPath": "/data/shared/products/foo", "parts":"1,256,1,0,0", 
          "sum": "d,25d231ec0ae3c569ba27ab7a74dd72ce", "source":"guest" } 

Posts are published on AMQP topic exchanges, meaning every message has a topic header.
The body consists of a time *20150813T161959.854*, followed by the two parts of the 
retrieval URL. The headers follow with first the *parts*, a size in bytes *256*,
the number of block of that size *1*, the remaining bytes *0*, the
current block *0*, a flag *d* meaning the md5 checksum is
performed on the data, and the checksum *25d231ec0ae3c569ba27ab7a74dd72ce*.


MetPX-Sarracenia
----------------

The MetPX project ( https://github.com/MetPX ) has a sub-project called Sarracenia which is intended
as a testbed and reference implementation for this protocol using AMQP. This implementation is 
licensed using the General Public License (Gnu GPL v2), and is thus free to use, and can be used to
confirm interoperability with any other implementations that may arise. While Sarracenia
itself is expected to be very usable in a variety of contexts, there is no intent for it
to implement any features not described by this documentation.  

The MetPX project also has the wmo_mesh sub-project, which implements a minimal subset of the
same message format, but works with MQTT in place of AMQP.  

This Manual page is intended to completely specify the format of messages and their 
intended meaning so that other producers and consumers of messages can be implemented.


v02
~~~

`sr_post version 2 reference man page <sr_post.7.rst>`_

Changes from v02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 03 is a change in encoding, but the semantics of the fields
are unchanged from version 02. Changes are limited to how the fields
are placed in the messages. In v02, AMQP headers were used to store name-value 
pairs.  

   * v03 headers have practically unlimited length. In v02, individual 
     name-value pairs are limited to 255 characters. This has proven 
     limiting in practice. In v03, the limit is not defined by the JSON 
     standard, but by specific parser implementations. The limits in common
     parsers are high enough not to cause practical concerns.

   * use of message payload to store headers makes it possible to consider
     other messaging protocols, such as MQTT 3.1.1, in future. 

   * In v03, pure JSON payload simplifies implementations, reduces documentation
     required, and amount of parsing to implement. Using a commonly implemented
     format permits use of existing optimized parsers.

   * In v03, JSON encoding of the entire payload reduces the features required for
     a protocol to forward Sarracenia posts. For example, one might
     consider using Sarracenia with MQTT v3.11 brokers which are more
     standardized and therefore more easily interoperable than AMQP.

   * v02 fixed fields are now  "pubTime", "baseURL", and "relPath" keys
     in the JSON object that is the messge body.

   * v02 *sum* header with hex encoded value, is replaced by v03 *identity* header with base64 encoding.

   * v03 *content* header allows file content embedding.

   * Change in overhead... approximately +75 bytes per message (varies.)
     
     * JSON object marking curly braces '{' '}', commas and quotes for 
       three fixed fields. net: +10

     * AMQP section *Application Properties* no longer included in payload, saving
       a 3 byte header (replaced by 2 bytes of open and close braces payload.) 
       net: -1 byte
       
     * each field has a one byte header to indicate the table entry in an AMQP
       packet, versus 4 quote characters, a colon, a space, and likely a comma: 7 total.
       so net change is +6 characters. per header. Most v02 messages have 6 headers,
       net: +36 bytes 

     * the fixed fields are now named: pubTime, baseUrl, relPath, adding 10 characters
       each. +30 bytes.

   * In v03, the format of save files is the same as message payload.
     In v02 it was a json tuple that included a topic field, the body, and the headers.

   * In v03, the report format is a post message with a header, rather than
     being parsed differently. So this single spec applies to both.
       

   


Optimization Possibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

optimization goal is for readabilty and ease of implementation, much more
than efficiency or performance. There are many optimizations to reduce
overheads of various sorts, all of which will increase implementation
complexity. examples: gzip the payload would save perhaps 50% size,
also grouping fixed headers together, ('body' header could contain
all fixed fields: "pubtime, baseurl, relpath, sum, parts", and another
field 'meta' could contain: atime, mtime, mode so there would be fewer
named fields and save perhaps 40 bytes of overhead per notice. But
all the changes increase complexity, make messages more involved to parse.


AMQP Feature Selection
----------------------

AMQP is a universal message passing protocol with many different 
options to support many different messaging patterns.  MetPX-sarracenia specifies and uses a 
small subset of AMQP patterns. An important element of Sarracenia development was to 
select from the many possibilities a small subset of methods are general and 
easily understood, in order to maximize potential for interoperability.

Analogy FTP
~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifying the use of a protocol alone may be insufficient to provide enough information for
data exchange and interoperability.  For example when exchanging data via FTP, a number of choices
need to be made above and beyond the protocol.

        - authenticated or anonymous use?
        - how to signal that a file transfer has completed (permission bits? suffix? prefix?)
        - naming convention
        - text or binary transfer

Agreed conventions above and beyond simply FTP (IETF RFC 959) are needed.  Similar to the use 
of FTP alone as a transfer protocol is insufficient to specify a complete data transfer 
procedure, use of AMQP, without more information, is incomplete. The intent of the conventions
layered on top of AMQP is to be a minimum amount to achieve meaningful data exchange.

AMQP: not 1.0, but 0.8 or 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AMQP 1.0 standardizes the on-the-wire protocol, but removed all broker standardization.   
As the use of brokers is key to Sarracenia´s use of, was a fundamental element of earlier standards, 
and as the 1.0 standard is relatively controversial, this protocol assumes a pre 1.0 standard broker, 
as is provided by many free brokers, such as rabbitmq and Apache QPid, often referred to as 0.8, 
but 0.9 and post 0.9 brokers could inter-operate well.

Named Exchanges and Queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In AMQP prior to 1.0, many different actors can define communication parameters, such as exchanges
to publish to, queues where messages accumulate, and bindings between the two. Applications
and users declare and user their exchanges, queues, and bindings. All of this was dropped 
in the move to 1.0 making topic based exchanges, an important underpinning of pub/sub patterns
much more difficult.

in AMQP 0.9, one subscriber can declare a queue, and then multiple processes (given the right
permissions and the queue name) can consume from the same queue. That requires being able
to name the queue. In another protocol, such as MQTT, one cannot name the queue, and so
this processing pattern is not supported.

The mapping convention describte in a Topic_ section, allows MQTT to establish separate 
hierarchies which provides a fixed distribution among the workers, but not exactly the
self-balancing shared queue that AMQP provides.


.. NOTE::

  In RabbitMQ (the initial broker used), permissions are assigned using regular expressions. So
  a permission model where AMQP users can define and use *their* exchanges and queues
  is enforced by a naming convention easily mapped to regular expressions (all such
  resources include the username near the beginning). Exchanges begin with: xs_<user>_.
  Queue names begin with: q_<user>_.  

Topic-based Exchanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Topic-based exchanges are used exclusively. AMQP supports many other types of exchanges, 
but sr_post have the topic sent in order to support server side filtering by using topic 
based filtering. At AMQP 1.0, topic-based exchanges (indeed all exchanges, are no
longer defined.) Server-side filtering allows for much fewer topic hierarchies to be used,
and for much more efficient subsciptions.

In Sarracenia, topics are chosen to mirror the path of the files being announced, allowing 
straight-forward server-side filtering, to be augmented by client-side filtering on 
message reception.

The root of the topic tree is the version of the message payload.  This allows single brokers 
to easily support multiple versions of the protocol at the same time during transitions.  *v02*,
created in 2015, is the third iteration of the protocol and existing servers routinely support previous 
versions simultaneously in this way.  The second sub-topic defines the type of message.
At the time of writing:  v02.post is the topic prefix for current post messages.

Little Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~

The AMQP messages contain announcements, no actual file data. AMQP is optimized for and assumes 
small messages. Keeping the messages small allows for maximum message throughtput and permits
clients to use priority mechanisms based on transfer of data, rather than the announcements.
Accomodating large messages would create many practical complications, and inevitably require 
the definition of a maximum file size to be included in the message itself, resulting in
complexity to cover multiple cases. 

Sr_post is intended for use with arbitrarily large files, via segmentation and multi-streaming.
Blocks of large files are announced independently and blocks can follow different paths
between initial pump and final delivery. The protocol is unidirectional, in that there 
is no dialogue between publisher and subscriber. Each post is a stand-alone item that 
is one message in a stream, which on receipt may be spread over a number of nodes. 

However, it is likely that, for small files over high latency links, it is 
more efficient to include the body of the files in the messages themselve, 
rather than forcing a separate retrieval phase.  The relative advantage depends on:

* relative coarseness of server side filtering means some filtering is done on 
  the client side.  Any data embedded for messages discarded on the client-side
  are waste.

* Sarracenia establishes long-lived connections for some protocols, such as SFTP,
  so the relative overhead for a retrieval may not be long.

* One will achieve a higher messaging rate without data being embedded, and if the
  messages are distributed to a number of workers, it is possible that the resulting
  message rate is higher without embedded data (because of faster distribution for
  parallel download) than the savings from embedding.

* the lower the latency of the connection, the lesser the performance advantage
  of embedding, and the more it becomes a limiting factor on high performance 
  transfers.

Further work is needed to better clarify when it makes sense to embed content
in messages. For now, the *content* header is included to allow such experiments
to occur.



Other Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AMQP has many other settings, and reliability for a particular use case
is assured by making the right choices.  

* persistence (have queues survive broker restarts, default to true),

* expiry (how long a queue should exist when no-one is consuming from it.  Default: a few 
  minutes for development, but can set much longer for production)

* message_ttl (the life-span of queued messages. Messages that are too old will not 
  be delivered: default is forever.)

* Pre-fetch is an AMQP tunable to determine how many messages a client will 
  retrieve from a broker at once, optimizing streaming. (default: 25)

These are used in declarations of queues and exchanges to provide appropriate
message processing.  This is not an exhaustive list.


Standards
---------

 * Sarracenia relies on `AMQP pre 1.0 <https://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf>`_  
   as the 1.0 standard eliminated concepts: broker, exchange, queue, and 
   binding.  The 1.0 feature set is below the minimum needed to support 
   Sarracenia's pub-sub architecture.

 * JSON is defined by `IETF RFC 7159 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7159>`_.
   JSON standard includes mandatory use of UNICODE character set (ISO 10646)
   JSON default character set is UTF-8, but allows multiple character 
   encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32), but also prohibits presence of 
   byte order markings (BOM.)

 * the same as Sarracenia v02, UTF-8 is mandatory. Sarracenia restricts JSON format 
   by requiring of UTF-8 encoding, (IETF RFC 3629) which does not need/use BOM.
   No other encoding is permitted.

 * URL encoding, as per IETF RFC 1738, is used to escape unsafe characters 
   where appropriate.

 * MQTT refers to `MQTT v3.1.1 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html>`_,
   the most widely implemented version at this time. Yes, v5 has user properties
   with 64K long strings, and has been standardized in 2017, but implementations 
   are (at the beginning of 2019) not plentiful.
