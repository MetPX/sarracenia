This is an Old Service
----------------------

In the 80's there was a huge modernization that replaced manual teletype systems with a 
server that automated routing or WMO data, using highly reliable mainframe technology from Tandem.
In the 90's there was a need for delivering file products, ill suited to WMO circuits to 
clients over tcp/ip networks. The Product Distribution Server was software originally 
implemented at that time, to run on Hewlett-Packard UNIX servers.

Layers Background,history,ahl1

In 2004, the Tandem had long been perceived as too expensive and 
was demonstrated that WMO bulletins were just a subset of files, so a merger of the two
switching networks was possible. Unfortunately PDS itself, burdened with design decisions
that prevented it from achieving necessary performance, had to be replaced to accomplish this.
Thus was born MetPX-Sundew. Sundew which, from 2004 to 2007, progressively replaced the Tandem
software and the PDS. All four programs operate on the same paradigm.

Obtain - Store - Forward
------------------------

Users submit requests for data, analysts find the data on their switch and arrange
for it to be forwarded to clients then next time it arrives.


Obtain: receive data from a channel, or actively poll a site to obtain it.
Store:  place it in a file tree.
Forward:  Consult routing tables, creating hard links to per-client transmission queue directories.

Sundew unified WMO bulletins with file transfer from PDS, but it had some implementation details that limited it's generality:

Layers Background,history,ahl1

 * file names based on WMO 386+PDS.  They are rigid.  No user hierarchy possible.
 * The 'routing' of data to client is done using hard links. A non-portable Unix specific paradigm.
 * no user could have any idea what data was available, to be able to ask for it.
 * no user obtain any data on their own.  They must ask. 
 * moving data around is a matter of programming a series of data pumps individually. 
   Each pump administrator must analyze based on routing in place.




What is Sarracenia?
-------------------

 * There is an internal tree of files.  Sarracenia itself does not care about tree structure.
 * there are no colons, so if you want such metadata, put it in directories.
 * expose that tree to everyone with HTML ( or SFTP.)
 * replace the hard-links with notifications.
 * Each destination can select the files of interest from the stream of notifications. 

Obtain:  a message is received which tell where to obtain a file from.
Store:   The file is written to a file tree.
Forward: A message saying where this file has been placed is sent out.


What is Sarracenia?
-------------------

Sarracenia does the same thing as Sundew, PDS, and Tandem before it, it just does it public.  

The difference is that rather than a fixed field private data-base, sarracenia
Just replicates any tree of files it is given.

Sarracenia itself does not impose any structure on any tree.

The clients run fine on MacOS & Windows as well.

Old Data Pumps
--------------------

'Acquiring' data meant talking to an analyst and having
the information accepted or picked up, and then classified for proper placement
in the tree.   
Show the tree.


Previous versions of pumps:
 * all addition of data is done by very expert data pump analysts.
 * two conversations:  Data sources to ingest data, various consumers about their reception.
 * Data sources don't understand what happens when it gets ingested into Pump tree.
 * source tree discarded ignored, etc...
 * Pump tree:  fixed format hierarchy with colons (PDS names)
 * DM1 namespace: created by code extraction from (impoverished) Pump Tree
 * additions include setting metadata (colon fields) just so.
 * data mart v1 (DM1) is one consumer, it means manual programming of directory trees based on patterns.



DM1 Model Advantages
--------------------

 * self-serve.  WYSIWIG.  browseable (not friendly, but possible.)
 * with AMQP notices (sarracenia) real-time feeds practical.
 * If someone misses a real-time feed, they can wget it (if it is still there.)
 * client and support can browse the tree and talk over the phone (tree visible.)
 * Documented, understood ... by EPS (literally unknown to my analysts.)



Weaknesses of Model
-------------------

  * no self-serve. Every acquisition and delivery is Administrator controlled.
  * extremely manual, time for analyst, lots of communications.
  * opaque: We don't know what data is.  Users don't see it.
  * Two trees: 1 private (per pump), 1 visible. forever mapping between them.
  * inflexible: no directories, only files with : fields (exactly 5 of them.)
  * You want it where? Not just one pump, every pump...
  * they are just patterns, file names can be selected that slide through.
  * rot:  People ask for data, but when the data disappears the routing configurations remain.
    clients don't know how to describe so that the analysts can find it easily.
  * deletion: a heck of a lot of cpu, huge peaks, increasing with #days retained.
  * deletion: additional i/o load 
  * deletion: snapshots make no sense (missing short-lived data.)
  * routing: Every pump is unique, routing through each pump on the network is manual. 
     (on WMO-GTS, every country has at least one pump, perhaps more. so there are hundreds.)




Problems with DM1 Tree
----------------------

 * Files with constant names being updated constantly. (good for some users, bad for others.)
 * Inability to archive and replay, because files disappear before archiving interval.
 * Requires single management of entire tree (sources could write anywhere?)
 * Large directories stay large (daily directories are smaller next day.)
 * significant cpu & i/o load in deleting files.  
 * hard to measure data flows (short life.)
 * folks who want a complete data set:  very difficult to impossible.
 * bad for others to leverage to build services with complete data.
 * heavy load of human curation (by all.)
 * cannot guess where new data will end up.
 * requires single admin for entire tree.
 * 2nd Custom tree created from minimal metadata manually by whoever gets the service request.
 * 2nd tree is unknown to analysts, not understood.


Please note: Sarra does not care about the tree, it supports DM1, DM2, or /data/gridpt.



Next Generation Data Pump Goals
-------------------------------

  * Transitivity: Once you get the data into the network, little to no work by
    admins required for it to traverse the entire network (> 1 pumps.)
  * Transparency: Subscribers can see all the data that is available, and self-serve if motivated.
  * Transparency: Subscribers can identify where the data came from, and contact the source for support.
  * Transparency: Sources can see their data on the pumps, so they know it arrived. 
  * Transparency: Sources can see who consumes the data they inject. 
  * Transparency: Sources can inject their data and tell clients where it will show up.
  * Domain neutral:  transmits weather, astronomy, or genetics with aplomb.
  * Clarity, Consistency:  If a file shows up, it should be *available* forever (many caveats to general stmt.)
  * Flexibility: Adjust provisioning for performance and capacity.
  * Simpler:  Less configuration (for the same routing load.)
  * Simpler:  client can do things if they wish (old stuff: no option.)
  * Simpler:  clients use directories, not colon fields, and they pick their own, any number, not 5.
  * Simpler: No Tree Translation, source names it, switch sees it, client downloads, same name*


\* client can change name, their problem.


Data Pump
---------

   * Data pump is one big tree of files, regardless of origin, made available
   * internal tree now same as presented to users.
   * Time is the universal variable.  must be able to find & delete efficiently.
   * Source is the next universal.  All data comes from a source.
   * No other meta-data is fixed.  
   * That creates the first two layers of the directory tree for pumps.
      YYYYMMDD/<source>
   * past that point, the trees are under source control.
   * Pumps delete data that is 'n' days old by deleting the trees.
     2nd pump in a network may longer different retention than 1st.

pumps scale: performance, response time, variety, and time horizon.

In order to avoid/minimize the configuration of individual pumps, one needs to ensure
that once data is injected to a pump, it can be relayed with minimal configuration.


Pump is Directory Tree
----------------------

  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | <Date>     | Root of the tree being the date is only simple & cheap solution to cleanup. |
  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | <Source>   | Provide a "Home" directory for identify where the data comes from.          |
  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | <anything> | Meant to be under <Source> control, entirely arbitrary.                     |
  +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Time dominates 'real-time' data pumps, need to separate data by time horizon.   Tradeoffs:

Flexibility & capacity vs. performance and assurance.

 * Need a single tree whose management can be easily automated.
 * Having trees separated by date and source makes it easy to compose trees from multiple sources.
 * Replicate data along a series of pumps, and program retention for each one.
 * intermediate pump could have shorter retention that ones later in the chain?
 * don't want sourceA writing into the directory tree of sourceB. analogous to home directories.

Application: Since Nov 2015
---------------------------

  * Sarracenia only supported new methods.  over summer/fall: Sundew compatibility added.
  * Data injection methods (sr_post, sr_watch) were prototypes, they are much better.
  * No plugins existed a year ago, now > 30 exist, gathering experience.
  * Administration required extensive understanding of rabbitmq.  Easier now.

    * rabbitmq 'shovels' replaced by sarracenia ones.
    * sr_audit now handles exchange and user creation and permissions
    * declare *user* and/or exchange.
    

Application Still Alpha?
------------------------
  
  * reports have not been fully implemented, so they might not work yet (defer?)
  * plugin API requires a little more work (nothing incompatible so far, but worried.)
  * sr_watch and sr_post change usage over last few months.
  * Static trees 
  * Proper interswitch routing.


Past Year: Deployments
----------------------

  * ddi was populated with much more data.  Performance issues explored and resolved.
  * SPCs:  OPSR --> WxApps (BULLPREP, Scribe, AVIPADS migrated.)
  * Dev: Several (dev) RADAR servers using subscription.
  * Monitoring: New XBand RADAR, and GOES-R data only available through new Pumps.
  * Pred:  ADE is fed with new data stream (poorly...)
  * Colonoscopy completed:  sundew feeds add extension, sarra support also.
  * SSL Support added on most pumps (to become default for AMQP.)
     * http(s) on datamart.
     * AMQP(s) on all internal pumps (not dd yet.)


Status
------

  * Much data from Sundew is visible in ddi.cmc.ec.gc.ca
  * Much data still has 'PDS Names' from Sundew (with the colons)
  * Much data is only available from SSC-DATAINTERCHANGE (with is *fake*)
  * sources are constructed as a best first guess by Data Interchange.
  * Almost all acquisition still done via Sundew. 
  * "Reports" routing not configured, just data (no users/time yet.)
  * static and documentation content not configured/supported yet.
  * refining plugin usage. (latest release permits stacking.)
  * px vs. ddsr (artificial temporary difference, should go away in time.)
  * old sundew systems (need to be de-commissioned, so feeds need to be moved.)
  * AMQP(s) on DM1 waiting for weather office backend upgrade (in progress.)



Immediate Work
--------------

  * HPCR support: CMOI mirrors:  (A<->B), and Science->EC.
  * De-colonization: complete removal of colons from file names.
  * NinJo deployment (March)
  * [collab.]science.gc.ca Services: hpfx, flux, pfd. (NRC and other partners, YOPP?)
  * geomet2 / flux.weather.gc.ca  (Same servers, same data.)
  * migrate many senders  sundew --> sarracenia
     maintenance upgrades (old sundew servers are on 10.04)
  * Add AMQP(s) support on DM1 


Further Work
------------

  * Configure reports... debug.
  * Add static content support (basically sarra configurations.)
  * Production migrations: URP, DMS, Weatheroffice.
  * perhaps ADE & CMOI. (unclear.)
  * gradual migration of acquisition. (basically port filters to sarra)
  * Dual-Centre Demonstration (Dorval+Edm) deployment. (Fall?)
    * unidata, ukmet doable any time (requires filters to be useful.)
    * RADAR dual-national configuration?
    * Talk with DMS...
