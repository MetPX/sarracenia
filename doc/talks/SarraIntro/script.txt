Layers Bkg,Features


Hi there!
I'm Peter Silva and I work for Shared Services Canada's Supercomputing group.
One of the tools we are using ourselves and offering to scientists is the 
Sarracenia Data Pump.  Let's see why it's useful.

Layers Bkg,People

Meet Alice and Bob!

Alice and Bob are colleagues in different companies, far away from each other.  Alice 
has sequenced the genetic code of a special frog, and wants to send the complete sequence
to Bob.

Layers Bkg,People,F0

When Alice tries to send the files, 
Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,DataStraight

she might find that they are stopped by a firewall.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Firewalls

slowed by a strange route,

or because there is no good tool they can both use.

Pumps
-----

It would be easier if Alice could just hand her file tree off to 
a data pump close to her network, configured by admins to use 
the best placement, methods and routes.  The pumps can forward files to 
eachother to get them to Bob. 

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,tAl2Aamqpdesc,Al2Aa

Alice uses the sr_post command to say: "I want my frog DNA folder to go to B and F!"

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Al2Aa,tAl2Axfer,Al2Axl

The green arrows are AMQP messages from Alice to pump A for each file in Alice's tree, 
Alice's local pump uses sr_sarra to fetch Alice's folder (in black), and then announces to 
anyone listening that Alice's folder is on A, and looking for a way to get to B and F.
PumpA tells Alice that it has done it's job by sending log messges back (the other Green ones.)

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,tAC,ACv

Pump C is listening (or subscribed) to Pump A, and since it knows 
the way to B and F, it fetches the folder from A, and then lets its neighbours
know that Alice's folder is on C, and trying to get to B and F.  
This process repeats.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,CDv

and repeats.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,D2Ev,D2F

and repeats.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,D2Ev,D2F,E2B

The arrows are blue where HTTP is used instead of SFTP to transfer the data. Pumps 
may use different tools, but Alice does not worry about it. The forwarding
is set up once by administrators, and works for anyone's future data going 
through.

Trust
-----

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,SepMGT

About Trust, the pumps are independent peers, with no trust between them or central management.  
They just agree to pump data on each others' behalf.  And of course, Bob does not 
have to trust Alice either. 

So the pumps forward the data to B, and Bob picks it up from there.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Al2Aa,Al2Axl,ACv,CDv,D2Ev,D2F,E2B,BtoldBob

But what if Pump E has a problem?

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Al2Aa,Al2Axl,ACv,CDv,D2F,EBoom


Redundant Subscriptions
-----------------------

Alice really wanted to make sure Bob got her folder, so she sent it to
B AND F. 


Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Al2Aa,Al2Axl,ACv,CDv,D2F,EBoom,BobFromF

How does Bob decide which pump is the primary, and which is the backup?
Look, B is not even in trouble here, it just is not getting any data from
E.  

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Al2Aa,Al2Axl,ACv,CDv,D2F,EBoom,BtoldBob,BobFromF

With Sarracenia, Bob can listen to both B and F all the time, and get 
Alice's folder from the pump that announces it first.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,EBoom,Others

With Sarracenia's logging, Alice can know when each pump got the folder,
and that Bob still got it through Pump F, even though it never went through B.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,EBoom,Others,OGotIt

Distribution
------------

If others are interested in the folder, they subscribe to it from their nearest pump
They will get the folder as it passes through their pumps on it's way to B and F,
so everyone gets it with only one pass through the long-haul, expensive network.
Alice will get log messages for each subscriber each file is delivered to.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,EBoom,Others,keys

Of course, if Alice only wants to share with Bob, the folder can be encrypted 
with a key she only shares with Bob.


Segmentation
------------

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps

Like a Star Trek Transporter, well perhaps High School Biology is closer,
Sarracenia dissects the frog into slices and sends them across the network in parallel.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,F1

Admins along the way set the number streams and speed to match capacity of each pipe 
in order to obtain the best managed performance on a mix of transfers on a network 
with many users.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,F1,F2

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,F2,FFBob

Each slice is fingerprinted (or checksummed) to allow pumps to know what they have 
already received, so when a file in Alice's folder is changed, only that 
slice crosses the network again.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,FBob

Routing to Groups 
-----------------

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers

Fingerprints also help if one needs data replicated over a large network of pumps,
such as for very high reliability applications.  In Sarracenia, pumps can answer to 
more than one name.  In this diagram, all the pumps answer to A as an alias.  if Alice 
posts to "A", The folder will go to all pumps.  Each pump just announces for it's 
neighbours, and propagates from pump to pump.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring

The switches just have to be connected somehow for full replication to occur.
With a single ring, the data will be crossing seven hops on average.  Dual ring
is better, but the precise arrangement does not matter. 

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring,Bisections

In general, the more links are added, the fewer hops are needed to cover all 
the pumps.  Copies happen from the first neighbour to get the data, and flows 
naturally over the fastest paths, going wherever it hasn't reached like water 
into a bucket.  Fingerprints stop the replication by identifying when data
has already been received.  

In this mesh, for example, you can see it takes three hops.

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring,Bisections,R0
Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring,Bisections,R0,R1
Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring,Bisections,R0,R1,R2
Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,GISCPeers,G0Ring,Bisections,R0,R1,R2,R3


As the configuration of Sarra links is very straight-forward, and even though it 
would be a very ugly diagram, it is reasonable to set up a full mesh for total redundancy,
and guaranteed hop count of 1.

Technological Basis
-------------------

Layers Bkg,Tech

Sarracenia is just a thin layer over mature industry standard technologies.
You do not have to use its tools to send or receive data.  A browser
or a wide variety of downloaders can be used to send, browse or download the data.

What will you be missing? you won't be notified of the arrival of your files as quickly, 
be able to use multiple streams and or download from redundant sources as easily, 
nor will Data publishers be able to easily track who received their products.

Layers Bkg,Tech,Message

The protocol to support these patterns is pretty simple: The AMQP messages 
we send just include: slice, fingerprint, and address information. 
It is documented in two man pages.  
Sarracenia is a 'reference implementation' and we would be 
pleased if there were others.


Local Alerting
--------------

Even if you do not need to send your folder anywhere, Sarracenia can be helpful:

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Net,Pumps,Alvin

Sarracenia notifications are more efficient and timely than polling a directory with 'ls'.  
Alvin could subscribe to Alice's posts on the same cluster, to get notified faster
and with reduced load, especially if there are many Alvins.

Does Sarracenia Actually Work Today?  
------------------------------------


This is a part of the data switching network for Environment Canada.  Our existing central data 
pumps, or Product Exchangers, use our older stack, and while it is a bit more complicated,
it does let us try out bits of sarracenia.


National Unified Radar Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Layers Bkg,Successes,SNURP

In this hybrid environment, we have demonstrated the dual server reliability strategy with
The National Unified Radar Processing (NURP) servers.   Two servers runs independently, and the
first product available is pulled into the pumps for distribution.  This is much
simpler to run than High-Availability strategies with shared disk and such, and has resulted
in a drop in the rate of calls for NURP availability issues from once or twice a month to zero.

Layers Bkg,Successes,SNURP,SN-B

GRIB to Germany
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For distribution, products are sent out to one data pump for consumers inside Environment Canada, 
and a second one for the public.  

Layers Bkg,Successes,SGermans

Last Spring, a German company adopted the new methods. They went from 15 million requests/day on the 
web server to 150 thousand, a 99% reduction.  All that polling traffic consumed about 30 
GBytes/day.  Now they are only using 60 GBytes/day, the size of the data actually want, and 
they are getting it faster.

PanAM Games
~~~~~~~~~~~

Layers Bkg,Successes,Spanam

For the 2015 Pan-AM games in Toronto. We needed to set up temporary offices, one inside
Environment, and the other completely outside our networks.  The old stack requires an ftp 
server (and a reachable address) at each temporary site.  For multiple desks, one would 
need to install another layer of distribution to get them to share the same feed.

Layers Bkg,Successes,Spanam,SP1

Sarracenia, on the other hand, leverages any WAN optimizer, 
eliminating the need for custom re-distribution.
 
The Games venue was a temporary office, with a typical client network permitting no inbound 
connections.  With Sarracenia,  The consumers just subscribe to the pump.  
They do not need a server.  Much simpler!  

Layers Bkg,Successes,Spanam,SP1,SP2

In last generation systems, the central switch adminstrators need to program every 
product delivered.  With Sarracenia, the consumers can adjust the feeds themselves, so 
fine-tuning is much simpler as well.


What's Next?
------------

Layers Bkg,NxtStp

We will start introducing the tools to data sources gradually. 

Project Alta
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Project Alta, we are contributing to Environment Canada's MSC Renewal.
When it makes sense, we apply the new methods to projects.  As improvement, 
is demonstrated, it becomes official and The data sent by old methods is gradually 
reduced.

Layers Bkg,NxtStp,N0

The First way we are tackling this is by splitting international data acquisition links
among the two sites.  So when one data centre goes down, the other one continues
to obtain some data.  

Layers Bkg,NxtStp,N0,N0_5

We are also bringing up services like DMS and NURP to the Edmonton Data Pump,
increasing its independence over time.

Layers Bkg,NxtStp,N0,N0_5,N1

A third angle is to re-arrange data collection, such as RADAR, by having them
feed both data centres.

HPC aka Science.gc.ca
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Layers Bkg,ResDA

Another application over the next year or two will be as one data transfer service
available for the Canadian Government's supercomputing infrastructure being deployed
collaboratively with the National Research Council as our first partner.  It will 
be offerred for use in Data Acquisition from instruments or third parties, as well
as for general purpose usage.

A Quick Review
--------------

Data sources inject their tree once and see exactly where it goes. 

Consumers get their data faster, with less infrastructure and can 
modify their feeds themselves.

The same small mechanism supports a variety of very useful patterns,
for higher reliability, elegance, and performace.

Administrators see a reduced load on their data pumps from more efficient
transfers, have less setup for each source, can place pumps more easily,
and have better monitoring of transfers. 


Wrapping Up
-----------

Layers Bkg,People,F0,Wrapup

While the tools are already faster than what we used before.
Work done so far has been on correctness, not performance.

These deployments have worked very well, and the reliability is 
terrific, but it is a bit of a challenge to explain, and set up.
We need to reduce the amount of assembly required.

This work is being done by the Data Interchange team to solve real-world everyday 
problems, and is simpler than the systems it is replacing.  

Still, it is not the most obvious way to transfer files.  
It takes a little getting used to, but I hope I have shown that there 
are good reasons to make the effort.

If you have questions, go to the web site, or, by all means, drop me an email.

Thanks for your time
