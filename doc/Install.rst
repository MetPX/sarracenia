Client Installation
-------------------

The package is built for python version 3.4 or higher. On systems where
they are available, debian packages are recommended. These can be obtained from the 
launchpad repository. If you cannot use debian packages, then consider pip packages 
avialable from PyPI. In both cases, the other python packages (or dependencies) needed
will be installed by the package manager automatically.


Ubuntu/Debian (apt/dpkg)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu 18.04 or later... and derivatives of same::

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ssc-hpc-chp-spc/metpx
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3-paramiko   # required for SFTP support.
  sudo apt install python3-dateparser # if this doesn't work (old ubuntu) try installing with pip.
  sudo apt-get install metpx-sarracenia  # only supports HTTP/HTTPS
  sudo apt-get install sarrac # optional C client.

Currently, only the debian packages include man pages.  The guides are only available in the source repository.

Redhat/Suse distros (rpm based)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python distutils on redhat package manager based distributions does not handle dependencies
with the current packaging, so one needs to manually install them.  For example:
On fedora 28::
 
  sudo dnf install python3-amqplib
  sudo dnf install python3-appdirs
  sudo dnf install python3-watchdog
  sudo dnf install python3-netifaces
  sudo dnf install python3-humanize
  sudo dnf install python3-psutil
  sudo dnf install python3-paramiko   # adds SFTP support.
  sudo dnf install python3-setuptools # needed to build rpm package.

optional::

  sudo dnf install python3-dateparser 

might not be available... if not, try::

   pip install dateparser 

Either way, dataparser is the only optional dependency. The poll 
component will not work without it, but everything else will.

One can then build an RPM file using setuptools::

  git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia
  cd sarracenia

  python3 setup.py bdist_rpm
  sudo rpm -i dist/*.noarch.rpm

This procedured installs only the python application (not the C one.)
No man pages or other documentation are installed either.
See C component documentation for installation instructions.


PIP
~~~

On other linux distributions where system packages are not available, the above procedures are not applicable.
You may also want to use this procedures on Windows, depending if Python is already installed.
There are also special cases, such as if using python in virtual env, where it is more practical to install
the package using pip (python install package) from `<http://pypi.python.org/>`_.
It is straightforward to do that::

  sudo pip install paramiko
  sudo pip install metpx-sarracenia

and to upgrade after the initial installation::

  sudo pip uninstall metpx-sarracenia
  sudo pip install metpx-sarracenia


NOTE:: 

   On many systems where both pythons 2 and 3 are installed, you may need to specify
   pip3 rather than pip.


Windows
~~~~~~~

On Windows, there are 2 (other) possible options:

**Without Python**
 Download Sarracenia installer file from `here <https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/~pas037/Sarracenia_Releases>`_, execute it and 
 follow the instructions. Don't forget to add *Sarracenia's Python directory* to your *PATH*.

**With Anaconda**
 Create your environment with the `file <../windows/sarracenia_env.yml>`_ suggested by this repository. Executing that command 
 from the Anaconda Prompt should install everything::

  conda env create -f sarracenia_env.yml

See `Windows user manual <windows/Windows.rst>`_ for more information on how to run Sarracenia on Windows.

Packages
~~~~~~~~

Debian packages and python wheels can be downloaded directly 
from: `launchpad <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx/+packages>`_


Source
------

Source code for each module is available https://github.com/MetPX::

 git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia sarracenia
 cd sarracenia

Development happens on the master branch.  One probably wants real release,
so run git tag, and checkout the last one (the latest stable release)::

  blacklab% git tag
    
  .
  .
  .
  v2.18.04b2
  v2.18.04b3
  v2.18.04b4
  v2.18.04b5
  v2.18.05b1
  v2.18.05b2
  v2.18.05b3
  v2.18.05b4

  blacklab% git checkout v2.18.05b4
  blacklab% python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
  blacklab%  pip3 install dist/metpx_sarracenia-2.18.5b4-py3-none-any.whl



Sarrac
------

The C client is available in prebuilt binaries in the launchpad repositories alongside the python packages::

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ssc-hpc-chp-spc/metpx
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install sarrac 

For any recent ubuntu version. The librabbitmq-0.8.0 has been backported in the PPA.
sarrac's dependency. For other architectures or distributions, one can build from source::

  git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac 

on any linux system, as long as librabbitmq dependency is satisfied. Note that the package does
not build or run on non-linux systems.


Building on Old Systems
-----------------------

Sarracenia requires python3, and python themselves do not support python3 older than 3.4.  Some older
Linux distributions either have no python3 or have such an old version that it is difficult to install
the necessary dependencies.

On Ubuntu 12.04::

  apt-get install python3-dev
  apt-get install python3-setuptools
  easy_install3 pip==1.5.6
  pip3 install paramiko==1.16.0
  pip3 install metpx_sarracenia==<latest version>

.. note::
   **Why the specific versions on older distributions?**

   pip > 1.5.6 does not support python < 3.2 which is the python in Ubuntu 12.04.

   Later versions of paramiko require the cryptography module, which
   doesn't build on python-3.2, so need to use an older version of paramiko
   which uses pyCrypto, and that does build on 3.2.

Sarracenia still works python 3.2, but there might be some cosmetic functionality 
missing. When having trouble installing sarracenia, one should try building the C 
client (sarrac) as it has fewer dependencies and should be easier to build on older systems.
