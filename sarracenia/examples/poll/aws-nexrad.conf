# Sample poll config, used to advertise availability of files off of AWS's public NEXRAD bucket
# To use, make sure rabbitmq is running as described in the Dev.rst documentation,
# and a tsource user/xs_tsource and xpublic exchanges exist, with FLOWBROKER set to the hostname
# rabbitmq is running on (e.g. export FLOWBROKER='localhost')
#
# If you want all the files from a specific day, you can uncomment poll_nexrad_day and specify
# the date you would like in the correct format.
