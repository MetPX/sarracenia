DESCRIPTION
===========

This document suppose that the reader is familiar with the concepts and usage
of **sundew** and **sarracenia**. 

**sundew** receiver supports a pull mechanism that allow querying a remote
server for new products to be ingested in the sundew product flow. There are
two types namely *pull-file* and *pull-bulletin*. The difference between them 
is the way in which the product is processed/routed once downloaded.

**sarracenia** supports the same mechanism. **sr-poll** announces the
new products from the remote site and **sr-sarra** makes the products
available, downloading and annoncing the product locally.

It is fairly straight forward to convert a pull reveiver configuration file
to both an **sr-poll** and **sr-sarra** that play the same role.  There
is a new concept in *sarracenia* where the *source* of the product
needs to be specified in the path of the file tree. 

Fortunately, in the context of this *PXATX* conversion, in our sundew system,
the products are placed properly in a sarracenia tree and announced with amqp
under a defined *source* directory. We will use these sources informations.

This document is solely based on the PXATX experience and so one should take
the ideas and apply them to his/her context.


METHODOLOGY
===========

I did this document using a very simple *sundew* pull receiver to make
sure to put just the right amount of details.

First set up a conversion environment. Where sarracenia is downloaded,
make sure you can use the bash script *pull_2_pollsarra.sh* by updating 
your PATH environment variable. Use *git clone* to get an updated version
of *sarracenia* ( See `Dev <Dev.rst>`_ ).  Make sarracenia tools available
for direct shell commands::

    export PATH=...wherever.../sarracenia/tools:$PATH

Define a place where you want to convert pxatx pull::

    mkdir -p convert/pxatx
    cd convert/pxatx

Get all the sundew configurations of sundew pxatx::

    scp -r px@pxatx1-ops:/apps/px/etc .
   
Here we pick the configuration pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf, and proceed
to its converstion::
  
    cd etc/rx
    pull_2_pollsarra.sh pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf

The original file looks like this ::

    #
    # STATUS:       Operational
    #
    # DESCRIPTION:  pull Wamr data from British Columbia Ministry of Environment (BC MoE)
    #
    # CONTACT:      BC MoE contact:  AQHIDSI@Victoria1.gov.bc.ca
    #
    #

    type pull-file

    routemask        true
    routing_version  1
    routingTable     /apps/px/etc/pdsRouting.conf

    protocol ftp
    host     fake.host.gc.ca
    user     fakeuser
    password fakepass

    delete False
    timeout_get 90
    pull_sleep  180

    extension pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII

    directory /pub/outgoing/WAMR/EarthNetworks2/
    get .*.lsi

    # generate key with accept
    accept .*(lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII).*

The script created these files::

    ls credentials *BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf
    credentials
    pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf
    poll_pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf
    sarra_get_pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf

My personal renaming convention is to rename the files ::

    mv poll_pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf
    mv sarra_get_pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.conf get_BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf

So now we have the sr_poll BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf and
the sr_sarra get_BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf.


SR_POLL CONFIG
==============

The generated *sr_poll* config looks like this:
cat BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf::

    #
    # STATUS:       Operational
    #
    # DESCRIPTION:  pull Wamr data from British Columbia Ministry of Environment (BC MoE)
    #
    # CONTACT:      BC MoE contact:  AQHIDSI@Victoria1.gov.bc.ca
    #
    #

    # on doit avoir le vip de ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca

    vip 142.135.12.146

    # post_broker is DDSR spread the poll messages

    post_broker amqp://SOURCE@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca/
    post_exchange xs_SOURCE

    # options

    sleep 180
    timeout 90

    # to useless... left for backward compat
    to DDSR.CMC,DDI.CMC,CMC,SCIENCE,EDM

    # where to get the products

    pollUrl ftp://fakeuser:fakepass@fakehost.gc.ca

    #where/how to get the products
    path /pub/outgoing/WAMR/EarthNetworks2/

    # generate key with accept
    accept .*(lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII).*

    # usually no accept... in sr_poll
    reject .*

The follows all the original option of the sundew pull as a reference.
To continue we need to know what product is ingested by that pull::

    ssh px@pxatx1-ops grep Ingested /apps/px/log/rx_pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR.log

We find that one of the product "today" is
29_05_2019_04_25.lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII
Lets try to find it on pxatx sarracenia side how it is announced::

    ssh sarra@data-lb-ops1 'cd master/pxatx; srl grep 29_05_2019_04_25.lsi \*.log'

Just picking one of the notice leads us to this place ::

    20190529/PROVINCIAL/BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR/12/29_05_2019_04_25.lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII

By convention the directory after the date is the name of the SOURCE
for these products. So here PROVINCIAL is used as an amqp source user
for announcement and as one of the top directory leaf for its products
With theses informations we can finalized the **sr_poll** config ::

    vi BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf

    change
    post_broker amqp://SOURCE@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca
    post_exchange xs_SOURCE**

    for
    post_broker amqp://PROVINCIAL@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca
    post_exchange xs_PROVINCIAL

The destination put by the script always contain all the credentials.
So we just edit to keep  protocol://user#host::

    change
    pollUrl ftp://fakeuser:fakepass@fake.host.gc.ca

    for
    pollUrl ftp://fakeuser@fake.host.gc.ca


Starting at comment  *# where to get the products*
down to the end of the file, the script attempted to reproduce
the *directory*, *get* and *accept/reject* options as in the original.
And finally it placed all the options of the original file as reference.
Make sure the sr_poll config is reflecting the original sundew one
Get rid of duplicated options, scrutening the rest of the file.
It is not our case here but if there are *reject* options in this config
keep them. For *accept* option, you dont really need them since option
*get* plays the same role::

    remove
    accept .*(lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:3:ASCII).*

After, change the *get* for *accept*.
So a cleaned version of the last lines of the *sr_poll* config would be::


    # where to get the products

    pollUrl ftp://fakeuser@fake.host.gc.ca

    # product source directories

    path /pub/outgoing/WAMR/EarthNetworks2/
    accept .*\.lsi


SR_SARRA CONFIG
===============

The generated *sr_sarra* config looks like this:
cat get_BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf::

    #
    # STATUS:       Operational
    #
    # DESCRIPTION:  pull Wamr data from British Columbia Ministry of Environment (BC MoE)
    #
    # CONTACT:      BC MoE contact:  AQHIDSI@Victoria1.gov.bc.ca
    #
    #

    # source

    instances 1

    # receives messages from same DDSR queue spreads the messages

    broker amqp://feeder@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca/
    exchange   xs_SOURCE

    # listen to spread the poll messages

    prefetch  10
    queue_name q_feeder.${PROGRAM}.${CONFIG}.SHARED

    sourceFromExchange True

    # what to do with product

    mirror        False
    preserve_time False

    # MG CHECK DELETE
    #delete False
    delete False

    # directories

    directory ${PBD}/${YYYYMMDD}/${SOURCE}/--${0}-- to be determined ----
    accept    .*(something).*

    # destination

    post_broker   amqp://feeder@localhost/
    post_exchange xpublic
    post_baseUrl http://${HOSTNAME}
    post_baseDir /apps/sarra/public_data

Again we need to adjust to the SOURCE value which is PROVINCIAL::

    vi get_BC_ENV_AQ_WAMR.conf

    change
    exchange   xs_SOURCE

    for
    exchange   xs_PROVINCIAL

A special attention must be given to the *delete* option.
If the sundew pull configuration is deleting the products once
downloaded, to test our *sr_sarra* process we must not delete
products. By default, the script writes ::

    # MG CHECK DELETE
    #delete value
    delete False

Where *value* is the setting of the *delete* option in the sundew pull.
The *sr_sarra* configuration, when ready, can be tested without deletion.
When placed in operation, and the sundew pull withdrawn, if the *delete*
option should be *true*  just delete the 'delete False' and uncomment the
'delete True'.

To have the proper *directory*, *accept* settings (there might be more than
one), we want to search how the products are disposed on the sarracenia side.
Because it is sundew processes that mimic sarracenia we find theses informatios
in the sundew senders::

    % grep PROVINCIAL/BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR ../tx/*
    % tx/ddsr-PROVINCIAL.inc:directory //apps/sarra/public_data/${RYYYY}${RMM}${RDD}/PROVINCIAL/BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR/${RHH}

And looking for the conplete configuration setting for these products in
this include file we get::

    directory //apps/sarra/public_data/${RYYYY}${RMM}${RDD}/PROVINCIAL/BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR/${RHH}
    accept .*.lsi:pull-BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR:GOV-BC:WAMR:.*

The final changes in our *sr_poll* config is to reflect that finding::

    change**
    directory \${PBD}/\${YYYYMMDD}/\${SOURCE}/--\${0}-- to be determined ----
    accept    .*(something).*

    for
    directory ${PBD}/${YYYYMMDD}/${SOURCE}/BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR/${HH}
    accept .*\.lsi.*

And we are all set for testing.


TESTING
=======

We install *sr_poll* BC_ENV_AQ_WAM.conf and *sr_sarra* get_BC_ENV_AQ_WAM.conf 
on DDSR_DEV. (on ddsr_dev, there are various things to modify. Setting *xattr_disable true*, changing ddsr.cmc for ddsr_dev.cmc, in broker... *document_root* option in senders and perhaps more)

Leave the processes running and check the right disposal/announcement of the products.


RELATED CLIENTS
===============

There are five clusters to check in order to see where the products
are going. Because these products are regularly coming in, we can
check in the logs.

1- are the products delivered on pxatx sundew ::

    ssh px@px-lvs-ops1 '. .bash_profile; cd /apps/master/pxatx; pxl grep BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR [ft]x*.log' | sed 's/:.*$//' | sort -u
    # which gives
    --- pxatx-new
    tx_ddsr-PROVINCIAL.log
    tx_ddsr-notify-PROVINCIAL.log
    tx_dms-op1.log
    tx_dms-op2.log

The *ddsr* processes are used to put the products on the sarra side of pxatx.
So the only senders to migrate would be *dms-op1* and *dms-op2*. We should use
and include for specific products whenever it is suitable.

2- lets check on the sarracenia side of pxatx (senders should be migrated to
   ddsr when the migration will occur)::

    ssh sarra@data-lb-ops1 '. .bash_profile; cd master/pxatx; srl grep BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR *.log' | sed 's/log:.*$/log/' | sort -u
    pxatx1-ops: sr_shovel_copy-ddsr-PROVINCIAL_0001.log
    pxatx2-ops: sr_shovel_copy-ddsr-PROVINCIAL_0001.log

   Ok so the messages are shoveled to ddsr (the products stay on pxatx)


3- are the products flowing on sundew ::

    ssh px@px-lvs-ops1 '. .bash_profile; cd /apps/master/sundew; pxl grep BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR [rft]x*.log' | sed 's/:.*$//' | sort -u

    --- px1-ops
    --- px2-ops
    --- px3-ops
    --- px4-ops
    --- px5-ops
    --- px6-ops
    --- px7-ops
    --- px8-ops

4- are the products flowing on ddsr : (this is slowwww)::

    ssh sarra@data-lb-ops1 '. .bash_profile; cd master/sarra; srl grep BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR *.log' | sed 's/log:.*$/log/' | sort -u


5- are the products flowing on ddsr.science ::

    ssh sarra@data-lb-ops1 '. .bash_profile; cd master/ddsr_science; srl grep BC-ENV_AQ-WAMR \*.log' | sed 's/log:.*$/log/' | sort -u
