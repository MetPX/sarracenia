 Case Study: HPC Mirroring 
===========================

-------------------------------------------------------
 Continuously Mirror 27 Million File Tree Very Quickly
-------------------------------------------------------


Summary
-------

This project has taken longer than expected, over three years, as the problem space was explored with the 
help of a very patient client while the tool to design and implement the efficient solution was eventually 
settled on. The client asked for a solution to make files available on the backup cluster within five
minutes of their creation on the primary one, and the first version of mirroring, deployed in 2017,
achieves roughly a 20 minute delay.  Version 2 was deployed in January 2020.

The client is actually more of a partner, who had very large test cases available and 
ended up shouldering the responsibility for all of us to understand whether the solution was working or not. 
While there are many specificities of this implementation, the resulting tool relies on no specific features 
beyond a normal Linux file system to achieve a 72:1 speedup compared to rsync on real-time continuous 
mirroring of 16 terabytes in 1.9 million files per day between two trees of 27 million files each. While
this averages to 185 Mbytes/second sustained over a 24 hour period. It should be noted that the transfers
are very peaky. On the same equipment at the same time, another
4 terabytes per day is being written to clusters on another network, so the aggregate read rate on
the operational cluster is 20 Terabytes per day (231 mbytes/second) for this application, while
the file systems are used for all the normal user applications as well.

While this project had to suffer through the development, with the lessons learned and the tools 
now available, it should be straightforward to apply this solution to other cases. The end result is 
that one adds a `Shim Library`_ to the users' environment (transparent to user jobs), and 
then every time a file is written, an AMQP message with file metadata is posted. A pool of transfer
daemons are standing by to transfer the files posted to a shared queue. The number of subscribers 
is programmable and scalable, and the techniques and topology to do the transfer are all easily 
controlled to optimize transfers for whatever criteria are deemed most important.


Problem Statement
-----------------

In November 2016, Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), 
as part of the High Performance Computing Replacement (HPCR) project asked for very large directory 
trees to be mirrored in real-time. Shared Services Canada (SSC) had primary responsibility for deployment
of HPCR, with ECCC/MSC being the sole user community. It was known from the outset that these trees would be too large to 
deal with using ordinary tools. It was expected that it would take about 15 months to explore the 
issue and arrive at an effective operational deployment. It should be noted that SSC worked throughout 
this period in close partnership with ECCC, and that this deployment required the very active participation of 
sophisticated users to follow along with the twists and turns and different avenues explored and implemented.

The computing environment is Canada's national weather centre, whose primary application is *production* numerical 
weather prediction, where models run 7/24 hours/day running different simulations (models of the atmosphere, 
and sometimes waterways and ocean, and the land under the atmosphere) either ingesting current observations 
aka *assimilation*, mapping them to a grid *analysis*, and then walking the grid forward in 
time *prediction/prognostic*. The forecasts follow a precise schedule throughout the 24hour cycle, feeding
into one another, so delays ripple, and considerable effort is expended to avoid interruptions and 
maintain schedule.

HPCR Solution Overview
----------------------

  :scale: 66 %


In the diagram above, if operations are in Data Hall 1 (left of centre) and they fail, then the goal is to resume 
operations promptly from Data Hall 2 (on the right). For this to be realistic, production data must be available 
in the other hall, on the other site store, quickly. The *mirroring* problem is synchronizing a very large 
subset of data between site store 1 and site store 2. For monitoring purposes, at the same time, a smaller 
subset to must be mirrored to data hall 0.


Continuous Mirroring
---------------------

There is a pair of clusters running these simulations, one normally mostly working on operations,
and the other as a *spare* (running only research and development loads).  When the primary fails,
the intent is to run operations on the other supercomputer, using a *spare* disk to which all the
live data has been mirrored. As there are (nearly) always runs in progress, the directories never 
stop being modified, and there is no maintenance period when one can catch up if one falls behind.

There are essentially three parts of the problem:
 
 * Detection: obtain the list of files which have been modified (recently).
 * Transfer: copy them to the other cluster (minimizing overhead.)
 * Performance: aspirational deadline to deliver a mirrored file: five minutes.
 
The actual trees to mirror were the following in the original contract phase (retrospectively called U0)::
 
 psilva@eccc1-ppp1:/home/sarr111/.config/sarra/poll$ grep directory *hall1*.conf
 policy_hall1_admin.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/admin
 policy_hall1_archive_dbase.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/archive.dbase
 policy_hall1_cmop.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/cmop/data/maestro/smco500
 policy_hall1_daily_scores.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/daily_scores
 policy_hall1_hubs.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/hubs
 policy_hall1_products.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/products
 policy_hall1_stats.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/stats
 policy_hall1_version_control.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/version_control
 policy_hall1_work_ops.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/work_ops
 policy_hall1_work_par.conf:directory /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/work_par
 psilva@eccc1-ppp1:/home/sarr111/.config/sarra/poll$ 
 
Initially, it was known that the number of files was large, but there was no knowledge of the actual 
amounts involved. Nor was that data even available until much later.

The most efficient way to copy these trees, as was stated at the outset, would be for all of the jobs 
writing files in the trees to explicitly announce the files to be copied. This would involve users 
modifying their jobs to include invocation of sr_cpost (a command which queues up file transfers for 
third parties to perform). However, the client set the additional constraint that modification of user jobs was 
not feasible, so the method used to obtain the list of files to copy had to be implicit (done by the 
system without active user involvement).

 
Reading the Tree Takes Too Long
-------------------------------

One could just scan at a higher level in order to scan a single parent directory, but the half-dozen 
sub-trees trees were picked in order to have smaller ones which worked more quickly, regardless of the 
method being used to obtain lists of new files. What do we mean when we say these trees are too large? 
The largest of these trees is *hubs* ( /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/hubs ). Rsync was run on the *hubs* 
directory, as just walking the tree once, without any file copying going on. The walk of the tree, using 
rsync with checksumming disabled as an optimization, resulted in the log below::
 
 psilva@eccc1-ppp1:~/test$ more tt_walk_hubs.log
 nohup: ignoring input
 rsync starting @ Sat Oct  7 14:56:52 GMT 2017
 number of files examined is on the order of: rsync --dry-run --links -avi --size-only /fs/site1/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/hubs /fs/site2/ops/eccc/cmod/prod/hubs |& wc -l
 27182247
 rsync end @ Sat Oct  7 20:06:31 GMT 2017
 psilva@eccc1-ppp1:~/test$
 
A **single pass took over five hours, to examine 27 million files or** examining **about 1500 files per second.** 
The maximum rate of running rsyncs on this tree is thus on the order of once every six hours (to allow some 
time for copying) for this tree. Note that any usual method of copying a directory tree requires traversing 
it, and that there is no reason to believe that any other tool such as find, dump, tar, tree, etc... would 
be significantly quicker than rsync. We need a faster method of knowing which files have been modified 
so that they can be copied.  

Detection Methods: Inotify, Policy, SHIM
-----------------------------------------

There is a Linux kernel feature known as INOTIFY, which can trigger an event when a file is modified. By 
setting an INOTIFY trigger on every directory in the tree, we can be notified when any file is modified 
in the tree. This was the initial approach taken. It turns out (in January 2017), that INOTIFY is indeed a 
Linux feature, in that the INOTIFY events only propagate across a single server. With a cluster file 
system like GPFS, one needs to run an INOTIFY monitor on every kernel where files are written. So rather 
than running a single daemon, we were faced with running several hundred daemons (one per physical node), 
each monitoring the same set of tens of millions of files. Since the deamons were running on many nodes, 
the memory use rose into the terabyte range. 
 
An alternate approach: instead of running the modification detection at the Linux level, use the file 
system itself, which is database driven, to indicate which files had been modified. The HPC solution's main 
storage system uses IBM's General Parallel File System, or GPFS. Using the *GPFS-policy* method, a query is 
run against the file system database at as high a rhythm as can be sustained (around five to ten minutes per 
query) combined with sr_poll to announce the files modified (and thus eligible for copying). This is 
completely non-portable, but was expected to be much faster than file tree traversal.
 
Over the winter 2016/2017, both of these methods were implemented. The INOTIFY-based sr3_watch was the 
fastest method (instantaneous), but the daemons were having stability and memory consumption problems, 
and they also took too long to startup (requires an initial tree traversal, which takes the same time 
as the rsync). While slower (taking longer to notice a file was modified), the GPFS policy had *acceptable* 
performance and was far more reliable than the parallel sr3_watch method, and by the spring, with deployment 
expected for early July 2017, the GPFS policy approach was selected.
 
As the migration progressed, the file systems grew in that they had more files in the trees, and the GPFS-policy 
method progressively slowed. Already in July 2017, this was not an acceptable solution. At this point, 
the idea of intercepting jobs' file i/o calls with a shim library was introduced. ECCC told SSC 
at the time, that having correct feeds, and having everything ready for transition was the 
priority, so the focus of efforts was in that direction until the migration was achieved in 
September. In spite of being a lower priority over the summer, a C implementation of the 
sending portion of the sarra library was implemented along with a prototype shim library to call it.
 
It should be noted that the GPFS-policy runs have been operationally deployed since 2017. This has
turned out to be *version 1* of the mirroring solution, and has achieved a mirroring to secondary
clusters with approximately 20 minutes of delay in getting the data to the second system. Three years
in, there is now an upgrade of the supercomputer clusters (called U1) in progress with two new additional
clusters online, The client is now using normal Sarracenia methods to mirror from the old backup cluster
to the new ones, with only a few seconds delay beyond what it takes to get to the backup cluster.

It should also be noted that use of GPFS policy queries have imposed a significant and continuous
load on the GPFS clusters, and are a constant worry to the GPFS administrators. They would very much
like to get rid of it. Performance has stabilized in the past year, but it does appear to slow
as the size of the file tree grows. Many optimisations were implemented to obtain adequate
performance.


Shim Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method settled on for notification is a `shim library <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>`_
When a running application makes calls to API entry points that are provided by
libraries or the kernel, there is a search process (resolved at application 
load time) that finds the first entry in the path that has the proper signature.
For example, in issuing a file close(2) call, the operating system will arrange
for the correct routine in the correct library to be called.

.. image:: HPC_Mirroring_Use_Case/shim_explanation_normal_close.svg

A call to the close routine, indicates that a program has finished writing the
file in question, and so usually indicates the earliest time it is useful to 
advertise a file for transfer. We created a shim library, which has entry
points that impersonate the ones being called by the application, in order
to have file availability notifications posted by the application itself,
without any application modification.

.. image:: HPC_Mirroring_Use_Case/shim_explanation_shim_close.svg

Usage of the shim library is detailed in `sr_post(1) <../Reference/sr3.1.html#post>`_


Copying Files
-------------

It needs to be noted that while all of this work was progressing on the 'obtain the list of 
files to be copied' part of the problem, we were also working on the 'copy the files to the 
other side' part of the problem. Over the summer, results of performance tests and other 
considerations militated frequent changes in tactics.  The *site stores* are clusters in 
their own right.  They have protocol nodes for serving traffic outside of the GPFS cluster. There are
siteio nodes with infiniband connections and actual disks.  The protocol nodes (called nfs or proto) 
are participants in the GPFS cluster dedicated to i/o operations, used to offload i/o from the 
main compute clusters (PPP and Supercomputer), which have comparable connections to the site store
as the protocol nodes. 

There are multiple networks (40GigE, Infiniband, as well as management networks) and the one
to use needs to be chosen as well.  Then there are the methods of communication (ssh over tcp/ip?
bbcp over tcp/ip? GPFS over tcpip? ipoib? native-ib?).

.. image:: HPC_Mirroring_Use_Case/site-store.jpg

Many different sources and destinations (ppp, nfs, and protocol nodes), as well many different 
methods (rcp, scp, bbcp, sscp, cp, dd) and were all trialled to different degrees at different 
times. At this point several strengths of sarracenia were evident:

* The separation of publishing from subscribing means that one can subscribe on the source node 
  and push to the destination, or on the destination and pull from the source. It is easy to 
  adapt for either approach (ended up on destination protocol nodes, pulling from the source).

* The separation of copying from the computational jobs means that the models run times are 
  unaffected, as the i/o jobs are completely separate.

* The ability to scale the number of workers to the performance needed (eventually settled 
  on 40 workers performing copies in parallel).

* The availability of plugins *download_cp*, *download_rcp*, *download_dd*, allow many different 
  copy programs (and hence protocols) to be easily applied to the transfer problem.

Many different criteria were considered (such as: load on nfs/protocol nodes, other nodes, 
transfer speed, load on PPP nodes). The final configuration selected of using *cp* (via the 
*download_cp* plugin) initiated from the receiving site store's protocol nodes.  So the reads
would occur via GPFS over IPoIB, and the writes would be done over native GPFS over IB.
This was not the fastest transfer method tested (*bbcp* was faster) but it was selected because 
it spread the load out to the siteio nodes, resulted in more stable NFS and protocol 
nodes and removed tcp/ip setup/teardown overhead. The 'copy the files to the other side' part 
of the problem was stable by the end of the summer of 2017, and the impact on system stability 
is minimized.
 

Shim Library Necessary
----------------------

Unfortunately, the mirroring between sites was running with about a 10-minute lag on the source files 
system (about 30 times faster than a naive rsync approach), and was only working in principle, with 
many files missing in practice, it wasn't usable for its intended purpose. The operational commissioning of the 
HPCR solution as a whole (with mirroring deferred) occurred in September of 2017, and work on mirroring essentially 
stopped until October (because of activities related to the commissioning work).

We continued to work on two approaches, the libsrshim, and the GPFS-policy. The queries run by the GPFS-policy had to to be tuned, eventually 
an overlap of 75 seconds (where a succeeding query would ask for file modifications up to a point 75 seconds before the last one 
ended) because there were issues with files being missing in the copies. Even with this level of overlap, there were still missing 
files. At this point, in late November, early December, the libsrshim was working well enough to be so encouraging that folks lost 
interest in the GPFS policy. In contrast to an average of about a 10-minute delay starting a file copy with GPFS-policy queries, 
the libsrshim approach has the copy queued as soon as the file is closed on the source file system.

It should be noted that when the work began, the python implementation of Sarracenia was a data distribution tool, with no support for mirroring.
As the year progressed features (symbolic link support, file attribute transportation, file removal support) were added to the initial package.
The idea of periodic processing (called heartbeats) was added, first to detect failures of clients (by seeing idle logs) but later to initiate
garbage collection for the duplicates cache, memory use policing, and complex error recovery. The use case precipitated many improvements in
the application, including a second implementation in C for environments where a Python3 environment was difficult to establish, or
where efficiency was paramount (the libsrshim case).

Does it Work?
-------------

In December 2017, the software for the libsrshim approach looked ready, it was deployed in some small parallel (non-operational runs). Testing
in parallel runs started in January 2018. There were many edge cases, and testing continued for two years, until finally being
ready for deployment in December 2019. I


* **FIXME:** include links to plugins

* **FIXME:** Another approach being considered is to compare file system snapshots.

As the shim library was used in wider and wider contexts to get it closer to deployment, a significant number of edge cases
were encountered: 

* use with non-login shells (especially scp) ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/66  ) 

* Buggy Fortran applications improperly calling close  ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/12  ) 

* tcl/tk treating any output to stderr as an failure ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues/69 )

* *high performance shell scripts* (  https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/15 )

* code that doesn't close every files ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/11 )

* code that does not close even one file ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/68 ) 

* there are paths in use longer than 255 characters ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/39 )

* clashes in symbols, causing sed to crash ( https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/80 )

Over the ensuing two years, these edge cases have been dealt with and deployment finally happenned
with the transition to U1 in January 2020. It is expected that the delay in 
files appearing on the second file system will be on the order of five minutes
after they are written on the source tree, or 72 times faster than rsync (see
next section for performance info), but we don´t have concrete metrics yet.

The question naturally arose, if the directory tree cannot be traversed, how do we know that the source and destination trees are the same?
A program to pick random files on the source tree is used to feed an sr_poll, which then adjusts the path to compare it to the same file
on the destination. Over a large number of samples, we get a quantification of how accurate the copy is. The plugin for this comparison
is still in development.  



Is it Fast?
-----------

The GPFS-policy runs are the still the method in use operationally as this is written (2018/01). The performance numbers given in 
the summary are taken from the logs of one day of GPFS-policy runs. 

 * Hall1 to Hall2: bytes/days: 18615163646615 = 16T, nb file/day:  1901463
 * Hall2 to CMC: bytes/days: 4421909953006 = 4T, nb file/day: 475085

All indications are that the shim library copies more data more quickly than the policy based runs, 
but so far (2018/01) only subsets of the main tree have been tested.  On one tree of 142000 files, the GPFS-policy run had a mean 
transfer time of 1355 seconds (about 23 minutes), where the shim library approach had a mean transfer time of 239 seconds (less than 
five minutes) or a speedup for libshim vs. GPFS-policy of about 4:1. On a second tree where the shim library transferred 144 
thousand files in a day, the mean transfer time was 264 seconds, where the same tree with the GPFS-policy approach took 1175 
(basically 20 minutes). The stats are accumulated for particular hours, and at low traffic times, the average transfer time with 
the shim library was 0.5 seconds vs. 166 seconds with the policy. One could claim a 300:1 speedup, but this is just inherent to 
the fact that GPFS-policy method must be limited to a certain polling interval (five minutes) to limit impact on the file system, 
and that provides a lower bound on transfer latency. 

On comparable trees, the number of files being copied with the shim library is always higher than with the GPFS-policy. While 
correctness is still being evaluated, the shim method is apparently working better than the policy runs. If we return to the 
original rsync performance of 6 hours for the tree, then the ratio we expect to deliver on is 6 hours vs. 5 minutes ... 
or 72:1 speedup. 

The above is based on the following client report:

Overheads
---------

What is the effect on user jobs of putting the shim library in service?
When used in large models with good i/o patterns necessary for high 
performance, the overhead added by the shim library can be negligeable.
However there is additional overhead introduced whenever a process is spawned,
closes a file, and when it terminates.  Shell scripts, which 
function by spawning and reaping processes continuously, see maximum
impact from the shim library.  This is explored in Issue https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac/issues/15 :

Issue 15 describes the worst case shell script that re-writes a file, one line
at a time, spawning and reaping a process every time. In that case, we see as
much as an 18 fold penalty in shell script performance. However re-writing
the shell script in python can yield a 20 fold improvement in performance, 
with almost no overhead from the shim library (360 times faster than the
equivalent shell script with the shim library active.)

So shell scripts that were slow before, may be much slower with the shim
library, but the accelleration available by re-formulating to more efficient
methods can have much larger benefits as well.
