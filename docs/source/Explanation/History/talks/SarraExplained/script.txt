Hi There, 

Let´s take a few minutes to understand how Sarracenia works, in order to understand
why it exists.   There will not be a useful demo in here, it´s just an explanation
of internals.

Let´s say someone wants to inject an image into the data pumping network.

We call people who inject data ´sources´, and a source runs the sr3_post command, 
which creates a message like the following and sends it to the AMQP broker running 
on a data pump:

AMQP Post Message:

This message tells people who receive it, that the NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif file is available if you use the afsiext 
account on cmcmdataserver and go to the folder data/NRDPS/outputs to retrieve it.  It also says that for public
posting, rather than being under the data/NRPDS/outputs directory, we want the folder tree to be NRPDS/GIF.

And now, a message from our Sponsor:

Need to pass messages between different programs?   
Need flexible ways for emitters and consumers to be matched with one another? 
Reliability?

Well The financial industry has decades of experience with message switches ´MQ Series´
or ´Enterprise Service Bus´ and in the past this meant adopting a single vendor´s stack.  The Advanced
Message Queueing Protocol is an effort, started by Morgan Stanley in 2004, to get an open, industry
standar interoperable message passing stack.  It has caught on since then, with many open source
implementations, and a lot of people have bought into it.

Like OpenStack:


and Intel´s High Performance Computing Stack.



AMQP is Super General, it will makes any kind of communication pattern you can think of easy, but it 
doesn´t say how to actually use it.   It´s a bit like Adopting ´XML´ for technical people.  XML gives
you a framework, or a vocabulary to talk about certain types of information management and exchange, but 
without an additional layer of specification, it does not achieve a useful business goal.
