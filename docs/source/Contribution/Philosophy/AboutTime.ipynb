    "* look at a different web site for closer in shots from polar orbiting satellites (e.g. HRDPS) that cover a smaller area.\n",
    "* look at a United States Geological Survey, or Water Survey of Canada web site to see the current stream flows.\n",
    "* look at a some weather web sites, to see the current observations from surface stations.\n",
    "* look at some Aviation (FAA or NAVCANADA web sites) to find weather observations at airports (which tend to have a tightly controlled quality, and so are relatively reliable.)\n",
    "* Find RADAR imagery on the net for the areas of interest (it might be that two or three RADAR stations have coverage of the area one is looking at.\n",

Essentially it uses the spreadsheet to calculate what the sky should look like one small step later in time, and then another step, and another, until you have arrived as far in time as needed for the forecast product.\n",

The bigger the volume covered by each cell, the more you are taking different data points and averaging them to get one value for the the cell, so the \"fuzzier\" the pictures that result.  \n",

    "How big are the spreadsheets? 30 years ago, the \"high resolution\" spreadsheet covering North America had each cell was 150 km. on a side, At that time, computers were not big enough to cover the whole world. Today, the high resolution models are around 10km on a side (100 sq. km.) As the area of the earth is around 500 million sq. km. that means that the grid today should be about 5 million cells. per level, models typically have 25 levels representing different heights of air in the atmosphere, so that means 125 million cells to calculate.\n",
