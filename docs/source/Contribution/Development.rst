 MetPX-Sarracenia Developer's Guide
====================================

:version: |release|
:date: |today|


Tools you Need
--------------


To hack on the Sarracenia source, you need:

- A linux development environment, either a workstation, or a VM of some kind.
  setup using ubuntu is automated, but adjustment for other distros is possible.
  command-line comfort a must.

- python3. The application is developed in and depends on python versions >= 3.5.

- style: PEP8 except max line length is 119, enforced via `pycodestyle <https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#disclaimer>`_ for VSCode, yapf3 or other similar tool.

- an account on github.com will help in submitting patches for consideration.

Things that will be installed by automated setup:

- a bunch of other python modules indicated in the dependencies (setup.py or debian/control)

- python3 pyftpdlib module, used to run an ftpserver on a high port during the flow test.

- git. in order to download the source from the github repository, and to prepare and submit
  changes.

- a dedicated rabbitmq broker, with administrative access, to run the sr_insects tests.
  this is installed by automated tools for setting up the linux environment.
  The flow test creates and destroys exchanges and will disrupt any active flows on the broker.

after you have cloned the source code::

    git clone -b development https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia sr3
    git clone -b development https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac sr3c
    git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects insects
    cd sr3

The rest of the Guide takes the above for granted.

Documentation
-------------

`Documentation Standards <Documentation.rst>`_ exist in /docs/Contribution/Documentation.rst
process for locally building the docs are there, as well as live web-site maintenance
methods.

Where to Put Options 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options are documented in sr3_options(7) dictionary style in alphabetic order.
Should it be worthwhile, examples of use could be added to other guides.


Development
-----------

In general, the development workflow is to get a laptop or a VM where one can run
the flow_tests (available from http://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects ) The first step
in configuring a development environment is ensuring that the sr_insects flow tests
work, as they function as a gate for commits to important branches. 

Development is most commonly done on Ubuntu >=18.04 platform. 


v2 Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~

Finished development work for version 2 is committed to on the v2_dev branch, which is used
to produce daily snapshots. One should not normally commit changes to the v2_dev branch,
but rather merge them from a working branch.

Development branches are named after the issue they are meant to address "v2_issue365", for
example. If there are multiple attempts to address a given issue, then use the issue
as a name prefix. For example, there could be issue365, but if we decide that isn't
a good way to address the issue, there could be an issue365_methodB branch.

**Before submitting a pull-request (PR), please ensure that the flow tests from
sr_insects have been run successfully:  at least static_flow, flakey_broker, and dynamic_flow**

When a PR is generated, the second developer can look it over for concerns.
Once satisfied with the nature of the patch, the second developer should pull the branch
and run the flow tests again (the same three) to confirm.  Only after the flow tests
have been run on multiple machines should a change be merged to main.

issues unique to v2 should be tagged *v2only*.
on Launchpad.net:

 * daily repository packages of v2 will be build from v2_dev 

 * pre-release repository packages of v2 will be build from v2_dev 

 * release repository packages are generated from v2_stable.


v3 Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~

The upcoming version of Sarracenia is developed in the development (work in progress) branch.
As the major refactor is substantially complete, the remaining work is now entirely constructive 
and all development is co-ordinated through issues exactly as v2 is. Issues unique to v3, be 
they regressions or enhancements that don't make sense to add to v2, have the tag *v3only*. 
Issues that are common between the releases are tagged *v3*.

The workflow with v3 is similar to v2 but with different branches.  branches are assumed
to be branched from the *development* branch, so v3 is assumed unless v2\_ is present.
Having all the flow tests complete fairly successfully
is one criterion for acceptance into development.

To run the sr_insects tests, the repository must be cloned with the development branch.
A gate for merging to development is for a second developer to run the flow_tests.
**For v03, these tests must run:  static_flow, flakey_broker, dynamic_flow, transform_flow**

Planned by 2022/04/11:

 * main will be merged from (version 3) development, so the default version for new work is sr3.

 * launchpad has recipes to produce metpx-sr3 packages from the main branch. 



sr_insects
~~~~~~~~~~

The sr_insects repository has it's own issues DB, and work on sr_insects is encouraged.
Both v2 and v3 are supported on the main branch of sr_insects.  That branch should be
used to support all development in both versions.... 


Local Installation
------------------

There are many different ways to install python packages on a computer. Different developers
will prefer different methods, and all the methods need to be tested prior to each release.
Sarracenia can work with either mqtt or amqp (most mature and stable) message passing libraries.
Install one of those first. in these examples, we use amqp.

* **Wheel** when people are running different operating systems (non-ubuntu, non-debian) people will be installing wheels, typically that have been uploaded to pypi.python.org.  On the other hand, it is a bit of a pain/noise to upload every development version, so we only upload releases, so testing of wheels is done by building local wheels. Need to build a new wheel every time a change is made.

* **pip install metpx-sr3[amqp]** would pull a wheel down from pypi.python.org. Generally not used during development of Sarracenia itself.
  one could also pull in all possible dependencies with **pip install metpx-sr3[all]**
* **pip install -e .[amqp] ... lets you edit the source code of the installed package, ideal for debugging problems, because it allows live changes to the application without having to go through building and installing a new package.

* **apt install metpx-sr3** install debian package from repositories, similarly to pip install (not -e), normally dev snapshots are not uploaded to repositories, so while this would be the normal way for users of ubuntu servers, it is not available during development of the package itself. Also need **apt install python3-amqp**

* **dpkg -i** builds a debian package for local installation. This is how packages are tested prior to upload to repositories.  It can also be used to support development (have to run dpkg -i for each package change.) also need **apt install python3-amqp**

The sr_insects tests invokes the version of metpx-sarracenia that is installed on the system,
and not what is in the development tree.  It is necessary to install the package on 
the system in order to have it run the sr_insects tests.

Prepare a Vanilla VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes creating a test environment for use in a virtual machine. One way to build
a virtual machine is to use multipass (https://multipass.run) Assuming it is installed, one can
create a vm with::

 multipass launch -m 8G -d 30G --name flow

need to have ssh localhost work in the multipass container.  Can do that by copying multipass
private key into the container::

This will provide a shell in an initialized VM.  To configure it::

 
  git clone -b development https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia sr3
  cd sr3

There are scripts that automate the installation of necessary environment to be able to run tests::

  travis/flow_autoconfig.sh
  travis/add_sr3.sh

You should be able to see an empty configuration::

  sr3 status

sr3c and sr3 are now installed, and should be ready to run a flow test from the sr_insects module, which
has also been cloned:

  cd ../sr_insects

The v03 branch of sr_insects supports testing of both v2 and v3, and both versions are now installed.
The flow tests are intended to be run to confirm compatibility between v2 and v3, and so one
must be able to test v2 as well::

  ubuntu@flow:~/sr_insects$ dpkg -l | grep metpx
  ii  metpx-libsr3c                    3.21.08a1-0~202108270410~ubuntu20.04.1 amd64        C-Implementation of a Sarracenia Client
  ii  metpx-sarracenia                 2.21.08-0~202108241854~ubuntu20.04.1   all          Directory mirroring in real-time for users, file servers and web sites.
  ii  metpx-sr3                        3.00.008exp                            all          v3 Directory mirroring in real-time for users, file servers and web sites.
  ii  metpx-sr3c                       3.21.08a1-0~202108270410~ubuntu20.04.1 amd64        C-Implementation of a Sarracenia Client
  ubuntu@flow:~/sr_insects$ 

The v2 package is metpx-sarracenia, whereas the v3 one is metpx-sr3. the flow tests will detect
which version is installed and test v3 if both are present.  To override that::

  ubuntu@flow:~/sr_insects$ export sarra_py_version=2.21.08
  ubuntu@flow:~/sr_insects$ 

Then one can run flow_tests from this shell normally.

Python Wheel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not used add_sr3.sh (which builds a debian package), then one can use this procedure
for local installation on a computer with a python wheel for testing and development::

    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

or... on newer systems, using build instead::

    python3 -m build --no-isolation

Should build a wheel in the dist sub-directory.
then as root install that new package::

       pip3 install --upgrade ...<path>/dist/metpx*.whl

Local Pip install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For local installation on a computer, using a pip
For testing and development::

   pip3 install -e .
   export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}

Using the local python package installer (PIP) to create a locally editable version.
The above will install the package in ~/.local/bin... so need to ensure the path includes
that directory.





Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For local installation on a computer, using a debian package.
This process builds a local .deb in the parent directory using standard debian mechanisms.
- Check the **build-depends** line in *debian/control* for dependencies that might be needed to build from source.
- The following steps will build sarracenia but not sign the changes or the source package::

    cd metpx/sarracenia
    sudo apt-get install devscripts
    debuild -uc -us
    sudo dpkg -i ../<the package just built>

which accomplishes the same thing using debian packaging.
The options are detailed below:


Committing Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What should be done prior to committing to the main branch?
Checklist:

- do development on some other branch. Usually the branch will be named after the issue being
  addressed. Example: issue240, if we give up on an initial approach and start another one, 
  there may be issue240_2 for a second attempt. There may also be feature branches, such as v03.
- **sr_insects tests works** (See Testing) The main branch should always be functional, do not commit code if the sr_insects tests are not working.
- Natural consequence: if the code changes means tests need to change, include the test change in the commit.
- **update doc/** manual pages should get their updates ideally at the same time as the code.

Usually there will be many such cycles on a development branch before one is ready
to issue a pull request. Eventually, we get to `Commits to the Main Branch`_


sr_insects Tests Description
----------------------------

Before committing code to the main branch, as a Quality Assurance measure, one should run 
all available self-tests. It is assumed that the specific changes in the code have already been unit
tested. Please add self-tests as appropriate to this process to reflect the new ones.
Generally speaking one should solve problems at the first test that fails as each test
is more complicated than the previous one.

There is a separate git repository containing the more complex tests https://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects

A typical development workflow will be (Do not try this, this is just an overview of the steps that will be 
explained in detail in following sections)::

   git branch issueXXX
   git checkout issueXXX
   cd sarra ; *make coding changes*
   cd ..
   debuild -uc -us
   cd ../sarrac
   debuild -uc -us
   sudo dpkg -i ../*.deb
   cd ..

   git clone -b development https://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects
   cd sr_insects
   sr3 status  # make sure there are no components configured before you start.
               # test results will likely be skewed otherwise.
   for test in unit static_flow flakey_browser transform_flow dynamic_flow; do
      cd $test
      ./flow_setup.sh  # *starts the flows*
      ./flow_limit.sh  # *stops the flows after some period (default: 1000) *
      ./flow_check.sh  # *checks the flows*
      ./flow_cleanup.sh  # *cleans up the flows*
      cd ..
   done

   #assuming all the tests pass.
   git commit -a  # on the branch...


Unit
~~~~

The *unit* test in sr_insects is the shortest one taking a minute or so, and not requiring
much configuration at all. They are sanity tests of code behaviour. Generally takes a minute
or two on a laptop.

Static Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~

The *static_flow* tests are a bit more complicated, testing more components, using single
threaded components in a linear way (all data moves uniformly forward.) It should be
more straight-forward to identify issues as there is no deletion and so it lends itself well
to repeating subset tests to identify individual issues. It takes about two minutes on a laptop.

Flakey Broker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *flakey_broker* tests are the same as the *static_flow*, but slowed down so that they last
a few minutes, and the broker is shutdown and restarted while the posting is happenning.  
Note that post_log prints before a notification message is posted (because post_log is an on_post plugin, and
that action, allows one to modify the notification message, so it needs to be before the post actually happens.)


Dynamic Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *dynamic_flow* test add advanced features:  multi-instances, the winnow component, retry logic testing, 
and includes file removals as well. Most of the documentation here refers to runnig the
dynamic_flow test, as it is the most complicated one, and the ancestor of the others.  The unit
test was separated out from the beginnig of the dynamic_flow test, and the static_flow is
a simplified version of the original flow test as well.

Generally speaking, one should run the tests in sequence and ensure the results of earlier 
tests are good before proceeding to the next test.

Note that the development system must be configured for the sr_insects tests to run successfully. See the next
section for configuration instructions. For development with a fresh OS installation,
the configuration steps have been automated and can be applied with the flow_autoconfig.sh
script in sr_insects (https://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects/blob/main/flow_autoconfig.sh). Blind 
execution of this script on a working system may lead to undesirable side effects; you have been warned!


The configuration one is trying to replicate:

Assumption: test environment is a Linux PC, either a laptop/desktop, or a server on which one
can start a browser. If working with the C implementation as well, there are also the following
flows defined:

Running Flow Tests
------------------

This section documents these steps in much more detail.  
Before one can run the sr_insects tests, some pre-requisites must be taken care of.
Note that there is Github Actions integration for at least the main branch
to verify functionality on a variety of python version.  Consult::

   https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/actions

.. Note::

  for the latest test results. Note that the results include dozens of tests, and are
  a bit unreliable, typically it may take a few retries for it to work completely
  (3 or 4 fail after initial attempt, then re-run the failed ones, and then
  perhaps 1 or two will be left, and on the third pass the last one passes.)


Install Servers on Workstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prepare a computer to run the flow test, one must install some server 
software and configurations. This same work is done by travis/flow_autoconfig.sh
which is run in `Prepare a Vanilla VM`_ but if you need to configure it 
manually, below is the process.

Install a minimal localhost broker and configure rabbitmq test users::

    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
    sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

    mkdir ~/.config/sarra
    cat > ~/.config/sarra/default.conf << EOF
    declare env FLOWBROKER=localhost
    declare env MQP=amqp
    declare env SFTPUSER=${USER}
    declare env TESTDOCROOT=${HOME}/sarra_devdocroot
    declare env SR_CONFIG_EXAMPLES=${HOME}/git/sarracenia/sarra/examples
    EOF

    RABBITMQ_PASS=S0M3R4nD0MP4sS
    cat > ~/.config/sarra/credentials.conf << EOF
    amqp://bunnymaster:${RABBITMQ_PASS}@localhost/
    amqp://tsource:${RABBITMQ_PASS}@localhost/
    amqp://tsub:${RABBITMQ_PASS}@localhost/
    amqp://tfeed:${RABBITMQ_PASS}@localhost/
    amqp://anonymous:${RABBITMQ_PASS}@localhost/
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@hpfx1.collab.science.gc.ca
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@hpfx2.collab.science.gc.ca
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@dd.weather.gc.ca
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@dd1.weather.gc.ca
    amqps://anonymous:anonymous@dd2.weather.gc.ca
    ftp://anonymous:anonymous@localhost:2121/
    EOF

    cat > ~/.config/sarra/admin.conf << EOF
    cluster localhost
    admin amqp://bunnymaster@localhost/
    feeder amqp://tfeed@localhost/
    declare source tsource
    declare subscriber tsub
    declare subscriber anonymous
    EOF

    sudo rabbitmqctl delete_user guest

    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user bunnymaster ${RABBITMQ_PASS}
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions bunnymaster ".*" ".*" ".*"
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags bunnymaster administrator

    sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
    cd /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv rabbitmqadmin rabbitmqadmin.1
    sudo wget http://localhost:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin
    sudo chmod 755 rabbitmqadmin

    sr --users declare

.. Note::

    Please use other passwords in credentials for your configuration, just in case.
    Passwords are not to be hard coded in self test suite.
    The users bunnymaster, tsource, tsub, and tfeed are to be used for running tests.

    The idea here is to use tsource, tsub, and tfeed as broker accounts for all
    self-test operations, and store the credentials in the normal credentials.conf file.
    No passwords or key files should be stored in the source tree, as part of a self-test
    suite.

Setup Flow Test Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the server environment is established, the flow tests use sftp transfers to localhost. 

It is also required that passwordless ssh access is configured on the test host
for the system user that will run the flow test. This can be done by creating
a private/public ssh key pair for the user (if there isn't one already) and copying
the public key to the authorized_keys file in the same directory as the keys (~/.ssh).
For associated commands, see http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html

Note that on systems where older versions of Paramiko (< 2.7.2) are installed, and the ssh key pair was generated with OpenSSH >= 6.5, manually testing the below command will work, but Paramiko will not be able to connect. This is likely the case if the ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` file contains ``BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY``. To work around this, convert the private key's format using ``ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa``.

To confirm that that passwordless ssh to localhost works::

   ssh localhost ls

This should run and complete.  If it prompts for a password, the flow tests will not work.

Check that the broker is working::

   systemctl status rabbitmq-server

One part of the flow test runs an sftp server, and uses sftp client functions.
Need the following package for that::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pyftpdlib python3-paramiko



The setup script starts a trivial web server, and ftp server, and a daemon that invokes sr_post.
It also tests the C components, which need to have been already installed as well 
and defines some fixed test clients that will be used during self-tests::

    cd 
    git clone https://github.com/MetPX/sr_insects
    cd sr_insects
    cd static_flow
    . ./flow_setup.sh
    
    blacklab% ./flow_setup.sh
    cleaning logs, just in case
    rm: cannot remove '/home/peter/.cache/sarra/log/*': No such file or directory

Run A Flow Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The flow_check.sh script reads the log files of all the components started, and compares the number
of notification messages, looking for a correspondence within +- 10%   It takes a few minutes for the
configuration to run before there is enough data to do the proper measurements::

     ./flow_limit.sh

sample output::

If the flow_check.sh passes, then one has a reasonable confidence in the overall functionality of the 
python application, but the test coverage is not exhaustive. This is the lowest gate for committing
changes to thy python code into the main branch. It is more qualitative sampling of the most
common use cases rather than a thorough examination of all functionality. While not
thorough, it is good to know the flows are working.

Note that the *fclean* subscriber looks at files in and keeps files around long enough for them to go through all the other
tests.  It does this by waiting a reasonable amount of time (45 seconds, the last time checked.) then it compares the file
that have been posted by sr_watch to the files created by downloading from it.  As the *sample now* count proceeds,
it prints "OK" if the files downloaded are identical to the ones posted by sr_watch.   The addition of fclean and
the corresponding cfclean for the cflow_test, are broken.  The default setup which uses *fclean* and *cfclean* ensures
that only a few minutes worth of disk space is used at a given time, and allows for much longer tests.

By default, the flow_test is only 1000 files, but one can ask it to run longer, like so::

 ./flow_limit.sh 50000

To accumulate fifty thousand files before ending the test.  This allows testing of long term performance, especially
memory usage over time, and the housekeeping functions of on_heartbeat processing.


Flow Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When done testing, run the ./flow_cleanup.sh script, which will kill the
running servers and daemons, and delete all configuration files installed for
the flow test, all queues, exchanges, and logs. This also needs to be done
between each run of the flow test::
  
  blacklab% ./flow_cleanup.sh

  Done!

After the flow_cleanup.sh, to check that a test has completed, use::

   sr3 status 

which should show that there are no active configurations.

If the static_flow test works, then re-run the other tests: flakey_broker, 
transform_flow, and dynamic_flow.

Dynamic Flow Test Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While most tests have a fixed duration, the dynamic flow test queries a remote
server and can run for any length desired. The dynamic flow_test length defaults
to 1000 files being flowed through the test cases. When in rapid development, 
one can supply an argument to shorten that::

  ./flow_limit.sh 200

Towards the end of a development cycle, longer flow_tests are adviseable::

  ./flow_limit.sh 20000 

to identify more issues. sample run to 100,000 entries::

  blacklab% ./flow_limit.sh 100000
  initial sample building sample size 155 need at least 100000 
  sample now 100003 content_checks:GOOD missed_dispositions:0s:0

This test was fired up at the end of the day, as it takes several hours, and results examined the next morning.

High volume sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trying the flow test with higher volume of notification messages (ie. 100 000) is one step closer to the goal of having a flow test running continously. This is motivated by our testing purposes. 

Limitation
++++++++++

Ubuntu have a limitation that tops inotify watches and that we encountered in `#204 <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues/204>`_ . We can overcome this by setting the related sysctl variable. First, check what is the limit of your system::

  $ sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 8196

If the limit is too low (ie. 8196), change it to a more appropriate level for the flow test::

  $ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

To make this change permanent add this line to ``/etc/sysctl.conf``::

  fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

Then excute ``sysctl -p`` and the system should now support high volume of inotify events.

Flow Test Stuck
+++++++++++++++

Sometimes flow tests (especially for large numbers) get stuck because of problems with the data stream (where multiple files get the same name) and so earlier versions remove later versions and then retries will always fail. Eventually, we will succeed in cleaning up the dd.weather.gc.ca stream, but for now sometimes a flow_check gets stuck 'Retrying.' The test has run all the notification messages required, and is at a phase of emptying out retries, but just keeps retrying forever with a variable number of items that never drops to zero.

To recover from this state without discarding the results of a long test, do::

  ^C to interrupt the flow_check.sh 100000

able to terminate. If there was a significant problem, the cumulation
would indicate it.

Flow tests with MQTT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flow tests can be run where certain components use the MQTT protocol, instead of AMQP.

FIXME: steps missing, more clarity required.

* MQTT broker is installed
* the bunnymaster tsource, tfeed, tsub users defined and given passwords (broker dependent.)
* for each user: an mqtt://user:pw@brokerhost  url's line is added to ~/.config/sr3/credentials.conf
* edit the variable MQP in ~/.config/sr3/default.conf, MQP is used by the flow tests.

Most components will use MQTT instead of amqp and can be run normally.

Commits to the Development Branch
---------------------------------

Aside from typos, language fixups in the documentation, and incrementing
the version, developers are not expected to commit to main. All work 
happens on development branches, and all testing is expected to pass before 
one considers affecting main. Once the branch development is complete, 
or a unit of work-in-progress is felt to be worth merging to main, one 
must summarize the changes from the branch for the debian change log, 
request on github.

::
   
   git checkout issueXXX  # v02_issueXXX for v2 work., github suggested branch names are fine also.
   vi CHANGES.rst # summarize the changes in Restructured Text
   dch # copy/paste from CHANGES.rst, inserting one leading space.
   vi doc/UPGRADING.rst # rarely, if code has user impact.
   vi doc/fr/UPGRADING.rst # bon... ceci est visible aux usagers, donc...
   git commit -a
   git push 
   # issue a pull request on github.com.

A Second developer will review the pull request and the reviewer will decide on whether
merging is appropriate. The developer is expected to examine each commit, and 
understand it to some degree.

The github Actions looks at pull requests and will flow tests on them.
If the tests pass, then that is good qualitative indicator, however the tests are a bit
fragile at the moment, so if they fail, it would be ideal for the reviewer to run
the tests in their own development environment. If it passes in the local developer
environment one can approve a merge in spite of Github Actions' complaints.  


Main Branches
-------------

There is a long running discussion about `Which Version is stable <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues/139>`_
The current set up is that there are four main branches:

* main branch is the release version of sr3, merging from development. used to build sr3 packages in the
  `MetPX <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx>`_ repository.

* development ... The `version 3 <v03.rst>`_ work in progress branch is a next version of sarracenia in development.
  the development branch is used to build sr3 packages for the `Daily <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx-daily>`_
  and `Pre-Release <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx-pre-release>`_ repositories on launchpad.net.

* issue branches to be merged to development, it should be start with issueXXX or suggested branch names from github are ok also.

* sometimes, multiple branches are needed for a single issue, say for variations of a fix, eg. issueXXX_2_do_it_this_way .

* v2_dev ... the integration branch for v2 maintenance used prior to promotion to v2_stable.

* v2_stable ... generally this branch gets code via merges from v2_dev, after the pre-release has been tested on a
  as many systems as possible. used to build packages on the stable: `MetPX <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx>`_
  

Repositories
------------

For Ubuntu operating systems, the launchpad.net site is the best way to provide packages that are fully integrated
( built against current patch levels of all dependencies (software components that Sarracenia relies
on to provide full functionality.)) Ideally, when running a server, a one should use one of the repositories,
and allow automated patching to upgrade them as needed.

Repositories:

* Daily https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx-daily (living on the edge... )
  automated daily build of sr3 packages happens from *development* branch.

* Pre-Release https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx-pre-release (for newest features.)
  from *development* branch. Developers manually trigger builds here when it seems appropriate (testing out
  code that is ready for release.)

* Release https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx (for maximum stability)
  from *v2_stable* branch.  After testing in systems subscribed to pre-releases, Developers
  merge from v2_dev branch into v2_stable one, and manually trigger a build.

for more discussion see `Which Version is stable <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues/139>`_



Building a Release
------------------

MetPX-Sarracenia is distributed in a few different ways, and each has it's own build process.
Packaged releases are always preferable to one off builds, because they are reproducible.

When development requires testing across a wide range of servers, it is preferred to make
an alpha release, rather than installing one off packages.  So the preferred mechanisms is
to build the ubuntu and pip packages at least, and install on the test machines using
the relevant public repositories.

To publish a release one needs to:

- Set the version.
- upload the release to pypi.org so that installation with pip succeeds.
- upload the release to launchpad.net, so that the installation of debian packages
  using the repository succeeds.
- upload the release notes and binaries to github.com.
- increment the version for future commits to v2_dev or development.

Versioning Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each release will be versioned as ``<protocol version>.<YY>.<MM> <segment>``

Where:

- **protocol version** is the message version. In Sarra notification messages, they are all prefixed with v02 (at the moment).
- **YY** is the last two digits of the year of the initial release in the series.
- **MM** is a TWO digit month number i.e. for April: 04.
- **segment** is what would be used within a series.
  from pep0440:
  X.YaN   # Alpha release
  X.YbN   # Beta release
  X.YrcN  # Release Candidate
  X.Y     # Final release
  X.ypostN #ack! patched release.

Currently, 3.00 is still stabilizing, so the year/month convention is not being applied.
Releases are currently  3.00.iibj
where:
  * ii -- incremental number of pre-releases of 3.00
  * j -- beta increment.

At some point 3.00 will be complete & solid enough that the we will
resume the year/month convention, hopefully 3.22.
 
Releases are classified as follows:

Alpha
  Snapshot releases taken directly from development, with no other qualitative guarantees.
  No guarantee of functionality, some components may be partially implemented, some
  breakage may occur.
  No bug-fixes, issues addressed by subsequent version.
  Often used for early end-to-end testing (rather than installing custom from tree on
  each test machine.)

Beta
  Feature Complete for a given release.  Components in their final form for this release.
  Documentation exists in at least one language.
  All previously known release block bugs addressed.
  No bug-fixes, issues addressed by subsequent version.

RC - Release Candidate.
  Implies it has gone through beta to identify and address major issues.
  Translated documentation available.
  No bug-fixes, issues addressed by subsequent version.

Final versions have no suffix and are considered stable and supported.
Stable should receive bug-fixes if necessary from time to time.
One can build python wheels, or debian packages for local testing purposes
during development.

.. Note:: If you change default settings for exchanges / queues  as
      part of a new version, keep in mind that all components have to use
      the same settings or the bind will fail, and they will not be able
      to connect.  If a new version declares different queue or exchange
      settings, then the simplest means of upgrading (preserving data) is to
      drain the queues prior to upgrading, for example by
      setting, the access to the resource will not be granted by the server.
      (??? perhaps there is a way to get access to a resource as is... no declare)
      (??? should be investigated)

      Changing the default requires the removal and recreation of the resource.
      This has a major impact on processes...

Example:

The first alpha release in January 2016 would be versioned as ``metpx-sarracenia-2.16.01a01``


Set the Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is done to *start* development on a version. It should be done on development
after every release.

* git checkout development
* Edit ``sarracenia/_version.py`` manually and set the version number.
* Edit CHANGES.rst to add a section for the version.
* run dch to start the changelog for the current version. 
  * change *unstable* to *UNRELEASED* (maybe done automatically by dch.)
* git commit -a 
* git push

If development continues and the time passes without the release occurring, then
the version needs to be set to again (or overwritten).  For example, a development
cycle begins in August, the version in main will be 3.19.08b1... but if development
continues into September, one should use this procedure the change the version to 3.19.09b1.

note on Debian terminology:

* unstable ... new software brought into the OS stablization tree.
* testing ... software considered stable enough to be included in the next "stable" release.
* stable ... part of a stable Debian release: frozen software that will not be patched except
  for security issues.

for Metpx-Sr3, we have not yet approached the longevity of versions implied by Debian *stable*.
The labels don't refer to how stable the software itself is, merely to how often the software
changes (increments versions.)  More info: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_version_history`_
so when performing releases, the changelog is changed from UNRELEASED to unstable, and
back to UNRELEASED when working between releases, as per Debian custom.

Releasing
~~~~~~~~~


When development for a version is complete. The following should occur:

A tag should be created to identify the end of the cycle::

   git checkout development
   git tag -a sarra-v3.16.01a01 -m "release 3.16.01a01"
   git push
   git push origin sarra-v3.16.01a01

Once the tag is in the development branch, promote it to main::

   git checkout main
   git merge development
   git push

Once main is updated on github, the docker images will be automatically upgraded, but
we then need to update the various distribution methods: `PyPI`_, and `Launchpad`_

Once package generation is complete, one should `Set the Version`_
in development to the next logical increment to ensure no further development
occurs that is identified as the released version.    


PyPi
~~~~

Pypi Credentials go in ~/.pypirc.  Sample Content::

  [pypi]
  username: SupercomputingGCCA
  password: <get this from someone>

Assuming pypi upload credentials are in place, uploading a new release used to be a one liner::

    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel upload

on older systems, or on newer ones::

   python3 -m build --no-isolation
   twine upload dist/metpx_sarracenia-2.22.6-py3-none-any.whl

Note that the CHANGES.rst file is in restructured text and is parsed by pypi.python.org
on upload.  

.. Note::

   When uploading pre-release packages (alpha,beta, or RC) PYpi does not serve those to users by default.
   For seamless upgrade, early testers need to do supply the ``--pre`` switch to pip::

     pip3 install --upgrade --pre metpx-sarracenia

   On occasion you may wish to install a specific version::

     pip3 install --upgrade metpx-sarracenia==2.16.03a9

   command line use of setup.py is deprecated.  Replaced by build and twine.


Launchpad
~~~~~~~~~

Automated Build
+++++++++++++++

* Ensure the code mirror is updated by checking the **Import details** by checking `this page for sarracenia <https://code.launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/metpx-sarracenia/+git/trunk>`_
* if the code is out of date, do **Import Now** , and wait a few minutes while it is updated.
* once the repository is upto date, proceed with the build request.
* Go to the `sarracenia release <https://code.launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+recipe/sarracenia-release>`_ recipe
* Go to the `sr3 release <https://code.launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+recipe/metpx-sr3-release>`_ recipe
* Click on the **Request build(s)** button to create a new release
* for Sarrac, follow the procedure `here <https://github.com/MetPX/sarrac#release-process>`_
* The built packages will be available in the `metpx ppa <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx>`_



Building a Windows Installer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

One can also build a Windows installer with that 
`script <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/blob/main/generate-win-installer.sh>`_.
It needs to be run from a Linux OS (preferably Ubuntu 18) in the root directory of Sarracenia's git. 
find the python version in use::

    fractal% python -V
    Python 3.10.12
    fractal%

So this is python 3.10.  Only a single minor version will have the embedded package needed
by pynsist to build the executable, so look at::

    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Then go look on python.org, for the "right" version (for 3.10, it is 3.10.11 )
Then, from the shell, run::

 sudo apt install nsis
 pip3 install pynsist wheel
 ./generate-win-installer.sh 3.10.11 2>&1 > log.txt

The final package will be generated into build/nsis directory.


Daily Builds

Daily builds are configured 
using `this recipe for python <https://code.launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+recipe/sarracenia-daily>`_ 
and `this recipe for C <https://code.launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+recipe/metpx-sarrac-daily>`_ and 
are run once per day when changes to the repository occur. These packages are stored in the `metpx-daily ppa <https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc/+archive/ubuntu/metpx-daily>`_.
One can also **Request build(s)** on demand if desired.

Manual Process
++++++++++++++

The process for manually publishing packages to Launchpad ( https://launchpad.net/~ssc-hpc-chp-spc ) 
involves a more complex set of steps, and so the convenient script ``publish-to-launchpad.sh`` will 
be the easiest way to do that. Currently the only supported releases are **trusty** and **xenial**. 
So the command used is::

    publish-to-launchpad.sh sarra-v2.15.12a1 trusty xenial


However, the steps below are a summary of what the script does:

- for each distribution (precise, trusty, etc) update ``debian/changelog`` to reflect the distribution
- build the source package using::

    debuild -S -uc -us

- sign the ``.changes`` and ``.dsc`` files::

    debsign -k<key id> <.changes file>

- upload to launchpad::

    dput ppa:ssc-hpc-chp-spc/metpx-<dist> <.changes file>

**Note:** The GPG keys associated with the launchpad account must be configured
in order to do the last two steps.



Backporting a Dependency
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Example::

  backportpackage -k<key id> -s bionic -d xenial -u ppa:ssc-hpc-chp-spc/ubuntu/metpx-daily librabbitmq


Building an RPM
+++++++++++++++

This process is currently a bit clumsy, but it can provide usable RPM packages.
Example of creating a multipass image for fedora to build with::

  fractal% multipass launch -m 8g --name fed34 https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/fedora/linux/releases/34/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-34-1.2.x86_64.raw.xz
  Launched: fed34                                                                 
  fractal%

Based on https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/create-rpm-package ...  install build-dependencies::

  sudo dnf install -y rpmdevtools rpmlint git
  git clone -b development https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia sr3

One can build a very limited sort of rpm package on an rpm based distro by
using the python distutils::

   python3 setup.py bdist_rpm

This will fail trying to open a non-existent CHANGES.txt... a strange incompatibility. So 

  **comment out the two lines in setup.py used to set the long_description**, 

these lines::
   #long_description=(read('README.rst') + '\n\n' + read('CHANGES.rst') +
   #                   '\n\n' + read('AUTHORS.rst')),
 
and then the rpm build will complete. Unfortunately, it doesn't add proper dependencies, so 
one can install those manually.  

A way of addressing the dependency problem  is to decode the options from the debian/control::

   [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$ grep Recommends debian/control | sed 's/Recommends: //;s/ //g'
   ncftp,wget
   [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$ 

and repeat with the setup.py file...  (note: setup.py does not want spaces around versions for 
python packages, but bdist_rpm option requires them, so fix that... )::

   [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$ tail -4 setup.py |  egrep -v '\[' | egrep -v ']' | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ *//g;s/>=/ >= /g;s/^"/"python3-/;s/,"/,"python3-/g'
   "python3-amqp","python3-appdirs","python3-watchdog","python3-netifaces","python3-humanize","python3-jsonpickle","python3-paho-mqtt >= 1.5.1","python3-paramiko","python3-psutil >= 5.3.0"
   [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$ 

then copy/paste the dependencies into the rpm building line::

   python3 setup.py bdist_rpm --requires=ncftp,wget,"python3-amqp","python3-appdirs","python3-watchdog","python3-netifaces","python3-humanize","python3-jsonpickle","python3-paho-mqtt >= 1.5.1","python3-paramiko","python3-psutil >= 5.3.0"

One can check if the dependencies are there like so::
  
  [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$ rpm -qp dist/metpx-sr3-3.0.6-1.noarch.rpm --requires
  /usr/bin/python3
  ncftp
  python3-amqp
  python3-appdirs
  python3-humanize
  python3-jsonpickle
  python3-netifaces
  python3-paho-mqtt >= 1.5.1 
  python3-paramiko
  python3-psutil >= 5.3.0
  python3-watchdog
  rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1
  rpmlib(FileDigests) <= 4.6.0-1
  rpmlib(PartialHardlinkSets) <= 4.0.4-1
  rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1
  rpmlib(PayloadIsZstd) <= 5.4.18-1
  wget
  [ubuntu@fed34 sr3]$

You can see all of the prefixed python3 dependencies required, as well as the recommended binary accellerator packages
are listed. Then if you install with dnf install, it will pull them all in.  Unfortunately, this method does not allow
the specification of version of the python dependencies which are stripped out. on Fedora 34, this is not a problem,
as all versions are new enough.  Such a package should install well.

a bit inelegant, and not sure if it will work with older versions:
`Help Wanted  <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues57>`_


github
------

Click on Releases, Edit the release:

* should we have release names?
* copy/paste of changes from CHANGES.rst
* copy/paste of Installation bit at the end from a previous release.
* build packages locally or download from other sources.
  drag and drop into the release.

This will give us the ability to have old versions available.
launchpad.net doesn't seem to keep old versions around.

 
Development Environment
-----------------------


Local Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Working with a non-packaged version:

notes::

    pip install -e .


Windows
~~~~~~~

Install winpython from github.io version 3.5 or higher.  Then use pip to install from PyPI.



Conventions
-----------

Below are some coding practices that are meant to guide developers when contributing to sarracenia.
They are not hard and fast rules, just guidance.


When to Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sr_report(7) notification messages should be emitted to indicate final disposition of the data itself, not
any notifications or report messages (don't report report messages, it becomes an infinite loop!)
For debugging and other information, the local log file is used.  For example, sr_shovel does
not emit any sr_report(7) messages, because no data is transferred, only messages.


Adding a New Dependency
-----------------------

Dependency Management is a complicated topic, because python has many different installation methods into disparate environments, and Sarracenia is multi-platform.  Standard python practice for dependencies is to make
them *required* by listing them in requirements.txt or setup.py, and require all users to install them.
In most python applications, if a dependency is missing, it just crashes with a import failure message
of some kind.

In Sr3, we have found that there are many different environments being deployed into where satisfying
dependencies can be more trouble than they are worth, so each of the dependencies in setup.py are also
dealt with in sarracenia/featuredetection, and the feature detection code allows the application to 
keep working, just without the functionality provided by the missing module. This is called *degradation*
or *degraded mode*. The idea being to help the user do as much as they can, in the environment they have,
while telling them what is missing, and what would ideally be added.

for a full discussion see:

`Managing Dependencies (Discussion) <https://github.com/MetPX/sarracenia/issues/741>`

Short version:

In addition to requirements.dev/setup.py, if you need to add a new library that isn't part of 
*batteries included*, typically provided by a separate os or pip package, then you want to 
provide for the package to still work in the event that the package is not available (albeit 
without the function you are adding) and to add support for explaining what's missing using 
the sarracenia/featuredetection.py module.

In that module is a *features* data structure, where you add an entry explaining the import 
needed, and the functionality it brings to Sr3. You also add if feature['x']['present'] guards
in the code where you are using the feature, in order to allow the code to degrade elegantly.

If the dependency is added in a plugin, then there is also a method for that described here:

`Plugin Developer Guide <../Explanation/SarraPluginDev.html#callbacks-that-need-python-modules>`
