    "The *after_accept* routine is one of the two most common ones in use. It is used to change processing prior to a file being downloaded or sent. To process the file after it has been downloaded, the *after_work* entry point is used to process the worklist.ok (files that were successfully downloaded) list.\n",

    "The after_accept routine has an outer loop that cycles through the entire list of incoming messages. It builds a new list of incoming messages from the ones it accepts, while  appending all the rejected ones to *worklist.failed.* The list is just a list of messages, where each message is a python dictionary with all the fields stored in a v03 format message. In the message there are, for example, *baseURL* and *relPath* fields:\n",

    "This is happenning before transfer (download or sent, or processing) of the file has occurred, so one can change the behaviour by modifying fields in the message. Normally, the download paths (called new_dir, and new_file) will reflect the intent to mirror the original source tree. so if you have *a/b/c.txt*  on the source tree, and are downloading in to directory *mine* on the local system, the new_dir would be *mine/a/b* and new_file would be *c.txt*.\n",

So the new file is created as in the previous section. The message for the downloaded file still needs to be moved onto a list to ensure that it is acknowledged to the broker. Such an entry point would look like this:"
