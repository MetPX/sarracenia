# This file should always contain the simplest instructions for setting
# up a first server on a debian/ubuntu server.
#

# The coniguration is for demonstration only, it is totally insecure.
# just a demo. 

1. install rabbitmq

sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server python3-amqplib
# using the entirely default configuration: no config of rabbitmq at all.


2. Verify that you can post and subscribe.

# cd into the root of the sarracenia tree, where the release notes are...


2.1 Build the coniguration for dd_subscribe.

cat >rawall.conf <<EOT 
# this is a raw feed of everything on the broker. 

host localhost

# AMQP exchange to connect to, sr_post creates it named after the user it uses to log in.
exchange guest

amqp-user guest
amqp-password guest


# This is the AMQP topic key for the exchange.  # is a wildcard to mean anything.

exchange_key #


# This is the metpx style filter directive, more fine grained than the exchange key.
# works on the file names themselves.  It uses regular expressions. .* is a wildcard
# which means accept anything.

accept .*
EOT

2.2 Start up the subscriber.
bin/dd_subscribe -n all.conf


2.3.  
Start a second shell in a second window, cd to the same folder.

python3 bin/sr_post  -b 12 `pwd` http://localhost/RELEASE_NOTES amqp://guest:guest@localhost/


3. Result.

dd_subscribe will display the raw notices received from sr_post.
 

4. add http server.

will do this once the sr_sub2 works with the v01 announcements.
