<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" role="doc-backlink">Executive Summary</a><a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Over the past decade, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information
Service WIS Part 1 has implemented meta data catalogues for some world-wide
meteorological datasets. In WIS-DAR, <em>Discovery, Access, and Retrieval</em>,
the emphasis on this early work was on <em>Discovery</em>, as this was a major
difficulty. In terms of actual data exchange, the pre-existing network: the
Global Telecommunications System (GTS) has remained the WMO’s accepted method
to circulate weather data in <em>meteorological real-time</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> used to
achieve <em>Access</em> and support <em>Retrieval</em>. It does so by established
bi-lateral agreements among individual members.</p>
<p>The pre-existing network feeds pre-existing systems that operate on different
premises from WIS, and there isn’t a particularly good mapping from <em>D</em>
to <em>A</em>, and <em>R</em> today. Use of WIS metadata to drive real-time data
exchange is not efficient, and GTS data is not easily interoperable with
other industries’ mostly web-based technologies.</p>
<p>This brief suggests that a mesh-like network of web servers is possible now
because of great advances in technology that reduce the need for rules and
structure for international exchange of meteorological data. Previously,
technological limitations placed stringent constraints on international data
exchange. These days, effective international data exchange can be arranged
with fewer interveners, less hierarchy, less coordination. A more
loosely coupled and flexible interconnection strategy makes it much
easier for members to exchange new datasets in a systematic way, without having
to develop the bi-lateral or multi-lateral exchange agreements.
Indeed often, the GTS is circumvented because it is so ill-suited
to such exchanges.</p>
<p>Members that agree to exchange data, can do so directly, which completes
the dream of the WIS. The existing work on WIS, standardizing metadata
exchange is completed by adding the exchange of the underlying
data using standardized open methods, with a straightforward mapping
from the metadata. As the proposed implementation uses
existing standards, the WMO does not need to define any additional ones,
and interoperability and access for other players in the broader
society should be straightforward. The sr3_post protocol, and
a number of existing implementations of it, are a great fit.</p>
<p>While it is believed that sr3_post protocol has great potential
to improve WMO data exchange, it will take a few years to adopt it,
and prior to adoption, there needs to be agreement on the file tree content.
Today, the next step would be to find some partner countries with which
to engage in some experimental data exchanges to validate the approach,
and collaboratively determine implementation details.</p>

<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information Service (WIS)’s Global
Telecommunications System (GTS) is the WMO’s accepted method to circulate
weather data in <em>meteorological real-time</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> It does so by pre-established
bi-lateral agreements about who circulates what to whom. When data
arrives, it is sent to the proper destinations immediately. In hardware terms,
the GTS used to be a set of point-to-point links. It is, in general, very reliable
and has good performance for the sorts of data for which it was envisioned.</p>
<p>The GTS successfully and elegantly applied the technologies of the 1940’s to
obtain world-wide exchange of weather data, most obviously, to enable
commercial air travel to expand exponentially over the succeeding decades. It
was made in a world of expensive point-to-point telephone links, very low
bandwidth, very little computational power, and few existing standards for
reliable data transfer. Today, The underlying technologies embodied by
Internet and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/computing/our-facilities/rmdcn">Regional Main Data Communications Network (RMDCN)</a>
(which have already subsumed the physical links of GTS) are completely
different: bandwidth and storage are relatively cheap, computing power is
cheaper, point-to-point links are now more expensive than multi-point clouds.
Today’s WMO members want to exchange orders of magnitude more data types
and higher volumes at higher speed.</p>
<p>The weather community has, in the past, needed to create standards because no
similar need in the rest of industry existed. Over the last few decades, as
internet adoption has broadened and deepened, horizontal solutions for most of
the technical issues addressed by WMO standards have emerged. The WMO’s
strategic direction always has been and will continue to be to use
technologies from the wider world and not define their own standards
unnecessarily.</p>

<section id="gts-is-limited-inflexible">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" role="doc-backlink">GTS is Limited &amp; Inflexible</a><a class="headerlink" href="#gts-is-limited-inflexible" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<img alt="../../_images/GTS_Routing.jpg" class="align-center" src="../../_images/GTS_Routing.jpg" />
<p>In the traditional GTS, when new data is made available by a National
Meteorological Centre (NMC), it needs to issue notices, and likely discuss with
their Regional Telecommunications Hub (RTH), about accepting and routing the
new data. The RTHs must discuss amongst each other whether to exchange the
data, and other NMC must further request from their RTH. For NMC <em>A</em> to make
data available to NMC <em>B</em>, the GTS staff at both NMC’s and all intervening
RTHs must agree and action the request.</p>
<p>Also, the routing tables at each NMC and each RTH are theoretically, but in
practice, not easily, inspectable. It may be that the product NMC <em>B</em> is looking
for is already available at their local RTH, but neither <em>A</em>, nor <em>B</em> have any
effective way of determining that, other than asking the administrators of B’s
RTH. Manual routing is ineffective, opaque and human resource intensive.</p>
<p>Lastly, the GTS has a maximum message size, which though it was raised from
14,000 bytes to 500,000 bytes in the last few years, is still very limiting.
This rules out many modern important data sets  (e.g. RADAR, Satellite, NWP).
WMO doesn’t need its own data transport, as is demonstrated by many
members’ use of protocols without such limitations, adopted from the broader
internet, such as FTP, SFTP, and HTTP. Even more often, such transfers
are accomplished by bi-lateral arrangement, as transfers of larger datasets
cannot be expressed in current GTS protocols.</p>
<p>The initial WIS, as formulated over a decade ago, was in part an attempt to address
this opaqueness by introducing some Information Management (IM) concepts, and
support for DAR: Discovery, Access, and Retrieval. All WMO members want to
know is which data is available from which centres. So we publish metadata to
Global Information Service Centres, where the world’s real-time weather
information is available and some means of retrieval is specified.</p>
<p>When dealing in the abstract, without time constraints, add/or with small
datasets, retrieval time does not matter, but the access penalty imposed by
using databases for individual retrieval grows with the number of
items stored and the number of queries or retrievals to be sustained.
Initially, WIS was most concerned with getting higher visibilty of data,
understanding what data was available. WIS Part 1 primarily implemented a
metadata layer, while the GTS has persisted to transfer actual data. Once
WIS Part 1 was in service and DAR was available, which at first blush appears
much easier and friendlier, why didn’t everyone just use DAR to replace the
GTS?</p>
<img alt="../../_images/dar.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/dar.png" />
<p>The WIS architecture tends to concentrate load at the GISCS, whether they want it
or not. Even assuming they want it, answering large volumes of queries in such
an architecture is a problem. The mental model for this is a database and each
retrieval is conceptualized as a query.  From computational complexity theory[2]_,
each query is often an O(N) operation (or in the best case of perfect indexing,
O(log N)) and retrieval of specific items by their key is also, at best, O(log N).</p>
<p>To perform Retrieval (the R in DAR) of all the items from an index, one
at a time, the best algorithm has complexity <em>N * log N</em>. The best case only
arises if the indices are properly designed for the access method intended.
In practice, without careful design &amp; implementation, the performance can
devolve to N**2.</p>

<p>Algorithmic complexity expresses how many computer operations are
needed to perform a function. For example, to search through a list of
N items sequentially would require a computer to perform N operations,
we then say the algorithm if on the order of N, or O(N). If one sorts
the list, a binary search takes only log N operations to find a
entry, written O(log N)

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" role="doc-backlink">Databases are Optimal for Fixed Sized Records. No One Uses Them That Way</a><a class="headerlink" href="#databases-are-optimal-for-fixed-sized-records-no-one-uses-them-that-way" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are typically two major schools of thought on meteorological data
storage: Files and Databases. For many years, data was relatively small,
there were relatively few datatypes, and they fit in small databases and
with enough analysis one could normalize them down to fixed size fields.</p>
<p>Relational databases were invented a decade or two after the GTS, and they
optimize storage and retrieval of fixed size data. They achieve near optimal
performance by careful selection of the data model and extensive use of
fixed size fields. In practice, the use of fixed size fields turns out to
be a difficult constraint to satisfy and many interesting data sets, especially
on systems whose primary function is data transmisssion, are most logically
stored as arbitarily sized byte sequences, generally termed: Binary Large
Objects, or BLOBS. When one stores BLOBS, a database becomes
algorithmically a little different from a file system.</p>
<p>Essentially BLOBS are an indexed list of byte streams. Once a database
uses BLOBS, it incurs the same overhead for data retrieval as
a properly used file system. Regardless of the storage method,
the cost of retrieval is going to be O(log N) for a known key.
In a file system, the key is the name. In a DB, the key is an object-id
or index value.  If one wishes to use multiple indices, then one
can still use a database, which is largely what WIS Part 1 is. It
is simply a standard pratice to store the actual data in BLOBS, and file
systems are a competitive method of storing those.</p>
<p>Over time, as data items grow in individual size, it makes progressively
more and more sense to store them in file systems, and to confine use of
database systems to store metadata and indices that point to the data
items stored in files.</p>

<section id="internet-push-is-a-poor-fit-for-large-feeds">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" role="doc-backlink">Internet Push is a Poor Fit for Large Feeds</a><a class="headerlink" href="#internet-push-is-a-poor-fit-for-large-feeds" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>So called <em>Push</em> technologies are actually <em>Pull</em>. A client asks a server if
they have new data available for them. The server responds with the list of new
data available, then the client pulls the data. This means that an entity
storing data has to retrieve the items from the data store (with an O(log N) cost
to each retrieval.) As the domain is <em>real-time</em> processing, the time for data
to be obtained by a client is also relevant, and bound by the maximum frequency
that a client is allowed to ask for updates. In general, the ATOM/RSS protocols
expect a minimum interval between polling events of five minutes.</p>
<p>Each polling event requires the server to examine its database for all
matching entries, this search is likely an order N operation. So the responses
to polling requests are expensive, and the retrievals from the data system are
likewise expensive, which likely motivates the usual discouragement of rapid
polling.</p>
<p>In the best case, indices based on time will be present, and one will be able
to search table with that dimension and incur log(N) operations to find the
earliest observation to retrieve, and then walk forward along that index.
In many practical cases, databases are not indexed by time, and so the initial
search is for all stations, and then one must examine the time for the entries
retrieved, which will incur N**2 operations, and in some cases it can be
even worse.</p>
<p>The actual cost of serving a client depends critically on the server’s indices
being optimally constructed. These characteristics are hidden in a database
and are not easily inspected by anyone but the database administrator.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" role="doc-backlink">Store And Forward is Often Better in Practice</a><a class="headerlink" href="#store-and-forward-is-often-better-in-practice" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>“Store and Forward” is a term we will use here to denote technologies that
deal with data on receipt, in contrast to simply storing the data and
awaiting clients’ polls. Real-time systems such as the GTS get around the
retrieval expense problem by storing and forwarding at the same time. When
a datum is received, a table of interested parties is consulted, and then
the forwarding is done based on the data already “retrieved”.</p>
<p>The cost to forward an item to a given client is closer to O( log N ).</p>
<p>This works as an optimization because one is forwarding the message at exactly
the time it is received, so the entire lookup and search process is skipped
for all those known consumers. For comparison, the polling web standards
standardizes the cost of search at every polling interval.</p>
<p>The cost of the search is highly variable and not under server control. Poorly
structured queries (e.g. by station, and then time) can result in an N*log(N)
query or even N-squared complexity.</p>
<p>This is especially acute for weather alert information, where a high polling
frequency is a business need, but the volume of data is relatively low (alerts
are rare). In such cases the polling data can be 10 times or even 100 times the
amount of data transfer needed to send the warnings themselves.</p>
<p>In practice, the load on servers with large real-time flows to many clients will
be orders of magnitude lower with a real push technology, such as the
traditional GTS, than supporting the same load with Internet Push technologies.
A separate but related cost of polling is the bandwidth for the polling data.
By forwarding notifications on receipt, rather than having to service polls, one
reduces overall load, eliminating the vast majority of read traffic.</p>
<p>A real-world example of bandwidth savings, from 2015, would be that of a German
company that began retrieving NWP outputs from the Canadian datamart using web-scraping
(periodic polling of the directory.) When they transitioned to using the
AMQP push method, the total bytes downloaded went from 90 Gbytes/day to
60 Gbytes per day for the same data obtained. 30 GBytes/day was just
(polling) information about whether new model run outputs were available.</p>
<p>The requirements for a store and forward system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TCP/IP connectivity,</p></li>
<li><p>real-time data transmission,</p></li>
<li><p>per destination queueing to allow asynchrony (clients that operate at different speeds or have transient issues),</p></li>
<li><p>application level identity guarantees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the ability to tune subscriptions, according to the client’s
interest will further optimize traffic.</p>
<p>In terms of internet technologies, the main protocols for real-time data
exchange are XMPP and websocket. XMPP provides real-time messaging, but it does
not include any concept of subscriptions, hierarchical or otherwise, or
queueing. Web sockets are a transport type technology. Adopting either of these
would mean building a domain specific stack to handle subscriptions and
queueing. The Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) is not web technology,
but it is a fairly mature internet standard, which came from the financial
industry and includes all of the above characteristics. It can be adopted
as-is and a relatively simple AMQP application can be built to to serve
notifications about newly arrived data.</p>
<p>While AMQP provides a robust messaging and queueing layer, a small additional
application that understands the specific content of the AMQP messages, and
that is the value of the Sarracenia protocol and application offerred
as the protocol’s reference implementation. Sarracenia sends and receives
notifications over AMQP. That application neither requires, nor has,
any WMO-specific features, and can be used for real-time data replication
in general.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/A2B_message.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/A2B_message.png" />
<p>A Sarracenia notification contains a Uniform Resource Location (URL) informing
clients that a particular datum has arrived, thus inviting them to download it.
The URL can advertise any protocol that both client and server understand: HTTP,
HTTPS, SFTP for example. If new protocols become important in the future,
then their implementation can be done with no change in the notification layer.</p>
<p>As these notifications are sent in real-time, clients can initiate
downloads while the datum in question is still in server memory and thus benefit
from optimal retrieval performance. As the clients’ time of access to the data
is more closely clustered in time, overall i/o performed by the server is
minimized.</p>
<p>A notification also contains a fingerprint, or checksum, that uniquely
identifies a product. This allows nodes to identify whether they have
received a particular datum before or not. This means that the risks of
misrouting data are lower than before because if there are any cycles in the
network, they are resolved automatically. Cycles in the connectivity graph are
actually a benefit as they indicate multiple routes and redundancy in the
network, which will automatically be used in the event of node failure.</p>

<p>Several robust and mature protocols and software stacks are available for many
data transport protocols: FTP, HTTP, HTTP(S), SFTP. A file server, as a means
of Transporting data is a solved problem with many solutions available from
the broader industry.  In contrast to data transport, pub/sub is an atomized
area with myriad niche solutions, and no clearly dominant solution.</p>
<p>The Advanced Message Queueing Protocol is an open standard, pioneered
by financial institutions, later adopted by many software houses large
and small. AMQP is a replacement for proprietary message passing systems
such as IBM/MQ, Tibco, Oracle SOA and/or Tuxedo. RabbitMQ is a prominent
AMQP implementation, with deployments in many different domains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://content.pivotal.io/blog/scaling-with-rabbitmq-soundcloud">Backend processing at an Internet startup ( Soundcloud )</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1347071">HPC Monitoring System ( Los Alamos National Lab )</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/reference/rpc.html">Cloud Infrastructure ( OpenStack )</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rabbitmq provides a mature, reliable message passing implementation
currently, but there are many other open source and proprietary
implementations should that ever change. AMQP <em>brokers</em> are
servers that provide message publish and subscribe services, with
robust queuing support, and hierarchical topic based exchanges.</p>
<p>Each Server runs a broker to advertise their own contribution, and they subscribes to
each others’ notification messages. Advertisements are transitive, in that each
node can advertise whatever it has downloaded from any other node so that other
nodes connected to it can consume them. This implements mesh networking
amongst all NC/DCPC/GISCs.</p>
<p>An AMQP notification layer added to the existing file transfer network would:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>improve security because users never upload, never have to write to a remote server.
(all transfers can be done by client initiated subscriptions, no write to peer servers needed).</p></li>
<li><p>permit ad-hoc exchanges among members across the RMDCN without having to involve third parties.</p></li>
<li><p>can function with only <em>anonymous</em> exchanges, to eliminate the need for authentication entirely.
additional explicit authentication is available if desired.</p></li>
<li><p>provide a like-for-like mechanism to supplant the traditional GTS
(similar performance to existing GTS, no huge efficiency penalties).</p></li>
<li><p>in contrast to current GTS: no product size limit, can function with any format.

<li><p>transparent (can see what data is on any node, without requiring human exchanges).
(Authorized persons can browse an FTP/SFTP/HTTP tree).</p></li>

<p>Similar to the choice of indices in databases, efficiency of exchange in file
servers depends critically on balancing the hierarchy in terms of numbers of files per
directory. A hierarchy which ensures less than 10,000 files per directory performs
well.</p>
<p>Example server: <a class="reference external" href="http://dd.weather.gc.ca">http://dd.weather.gc.ca</a></p>
<p>The tree on dd.weather.gc.ca is the original deployment of this type of service.
As an example of the kind of service (though the details would be different for WMO),
it has directory ordering as follows:</p>

<p>There is an initially fixed base url:

<p>These files do not follow WMO naming conventions, but illustrate some interesting
questions. In WMO bulletins, one should issue only one bulletin with the AHL: SACN31 CWAO 111200
For circulation to the WMO, these individual observations are collected and indeed sent
as a single SACN31 CWAO 111200, but that means delaying forwarding of CYBG, BYQQ, CYTR
reports while we wait until the end of the collection interval ( 12:05? ) before emitting
the collected bulletin. This datamart, for national use, offers individual observations
as they arrive in real-time, appending the station id as well as a randomizing integer
to the file name, to ensure uniqueness.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of an early prototype which remains in use.  The actual tree
for WMO use would likely be different.</p>
</div>
<p>Aside from the contents of the tree, the rest of the functionality proposed
would be as described. One can easily subscribe to the datamart to replicate
the entire tree as the data is delivered to it. While the application does not
require it, the standardization of the tree to be exchanged by WMO members
will substantially simplify data exchange. Most likely, an appropriate
tree to standardize for WMO uses would be something along the lines of:</p>

<p>If we have an ordering by Day ( YYYYMMDD ), then ORIGIN ( CCCC? ), then data
types, and perhaps hour then the trees that result would be nearly optimally
balanced, and ensure rapid retrieval. The optimal configuration is also clearly
visible since this tree is can be inspected by any WMO member simply by browsing
the web site, in contrast to databases, where the indexing schemes are
completely hidden.</p>
<p>Nodes copy trees from each other verbatim, so the tree is the relative location
on any node.  WIS metadata pointers to the actual data can then be
programmatically modified to refer to the nearest node for data, or a
straight-forward search algorithm can be implemented to ask other nodes, without
the need to resort to an expensive search query.</p>
<p>In AMQP, subscriptions can be organized into hierarchical topics, with the
period character (‘.’) as a separator. For this application, the directory tree,
with ‘/’ or ‘' as a separator replaced by AMQP’s separator is is translated
into an AMQP topic tree.  AMQP has rudimentary wildcarding, in that it uses the
asterisk (‘*’) to denote any single topic, and the hash symbol (‘#’) is used to
match any remainder of the topic tree.  So examples of how one could subscribe
selectively on a node are:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">v02</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="c1">#            -- all products from all Origins (CCCC)&#39;s on a node.</span>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The <em>topic prefix</em> (beginning of the topic tree) is constant for this discussion. Explanation:</p>
<p>v02 - identifies the protocol version.  Should the scheme change in future, this allows for a server
to serve multiple versions at once. This has already been used to progressively migrate from exp, to v00, to v02.</p>
<p>post - identifies the message format.  Other formats: report, and pulse. described elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<p>After this first level of filtering is done server side, Sarracenia implements a
further level of client-side filtering using
full <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a>
to either exclude or include specific subsets.</p>
<p>To exchange known data types, one needs only define the directories that will be
injected into the network. Nations can adopt their own policies about how much
data to acquire from other countries, and how much to offer for re-transmission.
To propose a new data format or convention, a country uploads to a new directory
on their node.  Other countries that wish to participate in evaluating the
proposed format can subscribe to the feed from that node. Other countries that
start producing the new format add the directory to their hierarchy as well. No
co-ordination with intervening parties is needed.</p>
<p>Should two countries decide to exchange Numerical Weather Products (NWP), or
RADAR data, in addition to the core types exchanged today, they simply agree on
the directories where this data is to be placed, and subscribe to each others’
node feeds.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14" role="doc-backlink">Simple/Scalable Peer Configurations for Nations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#simple-scalable-peer-configurations-for-nations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<img alt="../../_images/WMO_mesh.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/WMO_mesh.png" />
<p>Assume a mesh of national nodes with arbitrary connectivity among them.
Nodes download from the first neighbour to advertise data, transfers
follow the speed of downloading from each node. If one node slows,
neighbours will get notification messages from other nodes that present
new data earlier. So the network should balance bandwidth naturally.</p>
<p>National centres can have as much, or as little, information locally as
they see fit. The minimum set is only the country’s own data. Redundancy is
achieved by many nations being interested in other nations’ data sets. If
one NC has an issue, the data can likely be obtained from another node. NC’s
can also behave <em>selfishly</em> if they so choose, downloading data to internal
services without making it available for retransmission to peers.  Super
national nodes may be provisioned in the cloud, for management or resource
optimization purposes. These nodes will ease communication by adding
redundancy to routes between nations. With mesh style interconnection, in the
case of a failure of a cloud provisioned node, it is likely that connections
between countries automatically compensate for individual failures.</p>
<p>There is also little to no requirement for the super-national GISC in this
model. Nodes can be established with greater or lesser capacity and they can
decide for themselves which data sets are worth copying locally. As the
subscriptions are under local control, there is a sharply reduced need for
co-ordination when obtaining new data sets.
There is also no need for a node to correspond uniquely to a national centre.
There are many situations where members with more resources assist other members,
and that practice could continue by having nodes insert data onto the GTS
on other countries’ behalf. Redundancy for uploading could also be accomplished
by uploading to multiple initial sites.</p>
<p>If there are nodes that, for some reason, do not want to directly
communicate, they do not subscribe to each others notification messages directly. Each
can acquire data safely through intermediaries that each is comfortable with.
As long as there is a single path that leads between the two nodes, data will
arrive at each node eventually. No explicit action by intermediaries is needed
to ensure this exchange, as the normal network will simply route around
the missing edge in the graph.</p>
<p>If there is misbehaviour, other nodes can cease subscribing certain data on
a node or cease to bring in any data at all from a node which is injecting
corrupt or unwanted data. It could happen that some nations have very good
bandwidth and server performance. The motivation would be to obtain the data
most quickly for themselves, however by implementing this excellent service, it
attracts more demand for data from the rest of the world. If one node feels
they are shouldering too much of the global load of traffic exchange, there
are many straight-forward means to encourage use of other nodes: not posting,
delayed posting, traffic shaping, etc… All of these techniques are
straight-forward applications of industry technology, without the need to
resort to WMO specific standards.</p>

<p>A sample national mesh node (Linux/UNIX most likely) configuration would

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>subscription application to post national data to the local broker for
others ( Sarracenia )</p></li>
<li><p>subscription application connects to other nodes’ brokers ( Sarracenia )

<li><p>http server to serve downloads (plain old apache-httpd, with indexes).</p></li>
<li><p>ssh server for management and local uploads by national entities (OpenSSH)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The stack consists of entirely free software, and other implementations can be
substituted. The only uncommon element in the stack is Sarracenia, which so far
as only been used with the RabbitMQ broker. While Sarracenia
( <a class="reference external" href="https://metpx.github.io/sarracenia">https://metpx.github.io/sarracenia</a> )
was inspired by the GISC data exchange problem, it is in no way specialized to
weather forecasting, and the plan is to offer it to other for in other domains
to support high speed data transfers.</p>
<p>FIXME: add diagram comparing size of various code bases.</p>
<p>Sarracenia’s reference implementation is less than 20 thousand lines in Python
3. Clients have contributed open source partial implementations in javascript,
C#, and Go, and have implemented another in C was done to support the

<p>As the file servers in question present static files, transactions with the
proferred stack are completely stateless. Search engines crawl
such trees easily, and, given critical mass, one could arrange with search
engines to provide them with a continuous feed of notifications so that a given
user’s index could be updated in real time. These characteristics require no
work or cost as they are inherent to the technologies proposed.</p>

<p>A new application to process sr3_post messages can be re-implemented if there
is a desire to do so, as in addition to full documentation, source code
for a handful of <a class="reference external" href="../Overview.html#implementations">implementations</a>
(Python, C, Go, node.js), is readily publically available.
The python implementation has an extensive plugin interface available to
customize processing in a wide variety of ways, such as to add file
transfer protocols, and perform pre or post processing before sending
or after receipt of products. Interoperability with Apache NiFi has
been demonstrated by some clients, but they declined to release
the work.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19" role="doc-backlink">Priorities</a><a class="headerlink" href="#priorities" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>FIXME: Make a picture, with separate queues for separate data types?</p>
<p>In WMO GTS, data is segregated into alphanumeric vs. binary data, and within
a single flow, a priority mechanism was available, whose implementation was not
really specified. The goal is essentially for the most time critical data
to be transferrred before other queued information. When too much data
is sent over a high priority channel, some implementations can end up
starving the lower priority data, which is not always desirable.</p>
<p>The effect of priority is to establish separate queue for products at
each priority level. In this proposal, rather than having explicit priorities
within a single queue, one just uses separate queues for different
data sets. As high priority data must be smaller or infrequent than
other data in order to transferred and processed quickly, the queueing
on these high priority queues will naturally be shorter than those containing
other data. Since the mechanism is general, the details of implementation
do not require rigid standardization, but can be implemented by each
NMC to fit their needs.</p>
<p>In practice, Canadian deployments achieve sub-second warning forwarding
using only separate queues for high priority data types, such as warnings
and RADAR.</p>
<section id="inline-content-in-messages">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" role="doc-backlink">Inline Content in Messages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#inline-content-in-messages" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It is tempting to inline (or include) data within the AMQP messages
for <em>small</em> data types. The hope is that we avoid a connection initiation
and an extra round-trip. The typical example would be weather warnings.
Can we improve timeliness by including weather warnings in the AMQP data
flow rather than downloading them separately?</p>
<p>Whenever messaging brokers are benchmarked, the benchmarks always include
notes about message size, and the performance of the systems in terms
of messages per second are invariably higher with shorter messages. It
is fairly obvious that every system imposes a maximum message size,
that messages are normally kept in memory, and that the maximum message
size each peer would need to support would need to be specified in
order to assure interoperability. It isn’t clear that while individual
messages could benefit from inlining, that there isn’t a cost in overall
data pump performance that outweighs it.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, there are three possible approaches to
limiting message size:  truncation, segmentation, and thresholds.</p>
<p>Truncation: the current WMO limits messages to being less than 500,000
bytes. This prevents many modern data types from being transferred
(radar volume scans, satellite imagery, video, etc…) People
will suggest only warnings would be sent inline.  The current
format for warning messages is Common Alerting Protocol, a highly
flexible XML format which permits things like embedding media.
There is no maximum message size for CAP messages, and so one
could not guarantee that all CAP messages would fit into any
truncation limit we would impose.</p>
<p>Segmentation: To avoid truncation one could instead implement
sending of products segmented into multiple messages.  There is a
long, troubled, history of message segmentation in the GTS,
to the extent that segmentation was purged from GTS when
the message size limit was raised to 500,000 bytes.
Protocols like FTP, HTTP, TCP already do this work. Adding
another layer of software that replicates what is done at
lower levels is unlikely to be helpful. There is likely
very little appetite to define message segmentation to be
overlaid on AMQP message passing.</p>
<p>Note: The Sarracenia protocol implements file segmentation
(partitioning) over the data transfer protocols, with a
view to using it a far larger segment sizes, on the order
of 50 megabytes per segment. The purpose is to overlap file
transfer and processing (allowing the beginning of multi-gigabyte
files to begin before it is completely delivered.)</p>
<p>Threshold: It is likely that thresholding is the only reasonable
data inlining strategy. If the datum is larger than X bytes, use
another transport mechanism. This guarantees that only
data smaller than X bytes will be inlined. It provides
a message size for all brokers to optimize for. On
the other hand, it means that one must always implement
two transfer methods, since one cannot guarantee that
all data will fit into the AMQP stream, one must provision
for the alternate data path to be used when the threshold
is exceeded.</p>
<p>Picking X isn´t obvious. Data types are growing, with
future or current formats like: AvXML, CAP, ODIM, GIF
being an order of magnitude or more larger than traditional
alphanumeric codes (TAC.) Picking an X sufficient
for such data types is likely to be much harder on
the brokers, and no value we can pick will take <em>all warnings</em>.</p>
<p>As going forward, the intent is to use this method
with satellite imagery, RADAR data, and large GRIB data
sets, it is suspected that a great deal of high priority
data will exceed any reasonable value of X.  If we don’t
use separate queues for high priority data, then a
downward pressure on X comes from avoiding large
messages from overly delaying a higher priority
message from being sent.</p>
<p>To guarantee warning transfer performance, one would need
to guarantee it for the large warnings as well, which is
accomplished quite well using separate queues alone.</p>
<p>It isn´t clear that the value of X we pick for today
wil make sense in ten years. A higher X
will use more memory in the brokers, and will
reduce absolute message passing performance. The brokers
are the most critical elements of these data pumps,
and minimizing complexity there is a benefit.</p>
<p>Another consideration is how much time is saved. The Sarracenia
application maintain connections, so it does not cost a
connection establishment to transfer a file. One typically
operates a number of parallel downloaders sharing a queue
to achieve parallelism.  With the Canadian acquisition
of data from NWS, there are 40 processes pulling data
simultaneously, and there is very little queueing.  It may
be more important to initiate transfers more quickly
rather than to accellerate individual streams.</p>
<p>A final consideration is the separation of control and data paths.
The AMQP end point might not be the data transfer end point.
In Canadian high performance deployments, there are brokers which are separate
servers from the data movers. The broker’s only purpose is to distribute
load among the data mover nodes, where the ideal is for that distribution
to be as even as possible. In that design, It makes little sense to
download messages to the brokers, and may actually delay forwarding
by adding a hop (a further transfer to a data mover node before
forwarding.) The Canadian main data pump deployments transfer several
hundred messages per second, and we are not sanguine about adding
payloads into that mix.</p>
<p>In summary: Without inlining, current deployments already achieve
sub-second forwarding using separate queues alone. If we wish to
avoid re-introducing segmentation and reassembly, inlining is
likely only practical with a fixed maximum payload size. Determining
a reasonable threshold is not obvious, and once the threshold is
established, one must ensure that high priority traffic above
the threshold also transfers quickly, obviating the motivation
for inlining. High performance deployments often feature brokers
completely separate from the data transfer path, where the broker has
a load distribution function, and simpler data transfer nodes
do the transport work. A threshold adds complexity in the
application, adds load on the broker, which is the most
complex element to scale, and so may make the overall system
slower. It isn´t clear that the benefits will be worthwhile
compared to the overhead cost in real world loads.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21" role="doc-backlink">Caveat: Solution for This Problem, Not Every Problem</a><a class="headerlink" href="#caveat-solution-for-this-problem-not-every-problem" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>AMQP brokers work well, with the sarracenia implementations at the Canadian
meteorological service, they are used for tens of millions of file transfers
for a total of 30 terabytes per day. Adoption is still limited as it is more
complicated to understand and use than say, rsync. There are additional
concepts (brokers, exchanges, queues) that are a technical barrier to
entry.</p>
<p>Also, while brokers work well for the moderate volumes in use (hundreds of
message per second per server) it is completely unclear if this is suitable
as a wider Internet technology (ie. for the 10K problem). For now, this sort
of feed is intended for dozens or hundreds of sophisticated peers with a
demonstrated need for real-time file services. Demonstrating scaling to
internet scale deployment is future work.</p>
<p>There are many other robust solutions for the file transfer problem. AMQP
is best used only to transfer notifications (real-time transfer metadata), which
can be very large in number but small in volume, and not the data itself.</p>
