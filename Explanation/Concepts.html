<h1>General Sarracenia Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#general-sarracenia-concepts" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Sarracenia pumps form a network. The network uses <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">Message Queueing Protocol (MQP)</a> brokers as a transfer manager which sends notification messages of file availability in one direction and report messages in the opposite direction. Administrators configure the paths that data flows through at each pump, as each broker acts independently, managing transfers from transfer engines it can reach, with no knowledge of the overall network. The locations of pump and the directions of traffic flow are chosen to work with permitted flows. Ideally, no firewall exceptions are needed.</p>
<p>Sarracenia itself does no data transport. It is a management layer to co-ordinate the use of transport layers. To get a running pump, actual transport mechanisms (web or sftp servers) need to be set up as well (the most common for our use case being <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>). In the simplest case, all of the components are on the same server, but there is no need for that. The broker could be on a different server from both ends of a given hop of a data transfer.</p>
<p>The best way for data transfers to occur is to avoid polling, thus limiting unnecessary work and time. Suppliers of data will want to take advantage of writing appropriate sr3_post notification messages to advertise data that is ready. Similarly, it is ideal if the receivers of said data use subscribe components, and (if required) an on_file plugin to trigger their further processing. This ensures the file transfers from the source to the destination without polling for the data. This is the most efficient way of working, but it is understood that not all software can be made co-operative. Sarracenia components used to poll in order to start transport flows are known as poll, and watch.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Linux is the main deployment platform, and the only platform on which server configurations are deployed and tested. Other platforms are used as client end points (Windows, etc.). This isn´t a limitation, it is just what is used and tested. Implementations of the pump on Windows should work, they just are not officially tested.</p>
<p>Sarracenia pumps can be built on a single server or an array of them, (see <cite>Deployment Consideration &lt;DeploymentConsiderations.rst&gt;</cite> for more details ) .but all the concepts discussed below apply.</p>
<section id="the-flow-algorithm">
<h2>The Flow Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#the-flow-algorithm" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>All of the components (post, subscribe, sarra, sender, shovel, watch, winnow) share substantial code and differ only in default settings. Each component follows the same general algorithm known as the Flow algorithm. The steps for the Flow algorithm are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gather a list of notification messages</p></li>
<li><p>Filter them with accept/reject clauses</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the accepted notification messages</p></li>

<p>In the left hand column, one can see the name and general description of each component.
in the middle column, we see what the various phases of the Flow algorithm are applied.
On the right, we see how to express, in a generic flow configuration file, the component.
Most components can just use the parent flow class, but those that need custom python
code use flow subclasses. Those cases are configured using the flowMain option.</p>
<p>Users can write their own flow subclasses and make their own components.</p>
<p>Components are easily composed using AMQP brokers, which create elegant networks of communicating sequential processes (in the <a class="reference external" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=359576.359585">Hoare</a> sense).</p>

<section id="multiple-processes-instances-singletons-and-vip">
<h2>Multiple processes: Instances, Singletons and VIP<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-processes-instances-singletons-and-vip" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The flow algorithm isn’t confined to a single process. Many processes can run the same flow configuration. For the sarra, sender, shovel and subscribe, components, one sets the <em>instance</em> setting to the number of processes to run and consume from the configured <em>queue</em> that they share.</p>
<p>The poll, post, and watch components, by contrast, are limited to a single process on any given server. In the table above, there is a note about <em>has_vip</em>. When there are multiple servers participating in a configuration, the vip directive can be used to have the servers co-operate to provide a single service (where only one server is active at a time.) For most components, the vip directive in a configuration file defines a virtual ip address that a server must have actively on it for that component to be active. If Sarracenia detects that the interface is not present on the server, then the component will run in passive mode.</p>
<p>For almost all components, passive mode means that no processing will occur. The node will passively check if it has obtained the vip. If the node does not have the vip, it will stand by indefinitely.</p>
<p>The exception to this is poll, which works differently. In poll, when you do not have the vip the following algorithmic loop will continue:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gather</p></li>
<li><p>filter</p></li>
<li><p>after_accept</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The poll’s gather (and/or poll) subscribes to the exchange other vip participants are posting to and updates its cache from the notification messages, avoiding the other polls from having to poll the same endpoint for the same file list.</p>

<h2>Mapping AMQP Concepts to Sarracenia<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-amqp-concepts-to-sarracenia" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>It is helpful to understand a bit about AMQP to work with Sarracenia. AMQP is a vast and interesting topic in its own right. No attempt is made to explain the entirety of it here. This section intends to provide a little context and introduce background concepts needed to understand and/or use Sarracenia. For more information on AMQP itself, a set of links is maintained at the <a class="reference external" href="sarra.rst#amqp">Metpx web site</a></p>

<p>An AMQP Server is called a broker. A <em>broker</em> is sometimes used to refer to the software, other times server running the broker software (same confusion as <em>web server</em>.) In the above diagram, AMQP vocabulary is in Orange, and Sarracenia terms are in blue. There are many different broker software implementations. In our implementations we use rabbitmq. We are not trying to be rabbitmq specific, but it is to be noted that management functions differ between implementations.</p>

<p>MetPX-Sarracenia is only a light wrapper/coating around Message Queueing Protocols. For those who are familiar with the underlying protocols, these are the mappings:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A MetPX-Sarracenia data pump is a python AMQP application that uses a (rabbitmq) broker to co-ordinate SFTP and HTTP client data transfers, and accompanies a web server (apache) and sftp server (openssh), often on the same user-facing address.</p></li>
<li><p>A MetPX-Sarracenia data pump can also work with rabbitmq replaced by an MQTT broker such as mosquitto.org (but some administrivia must be handled manually).</p></li>
<li><p>Wherever reasonable, we use their terminology and syntax. If someone knows AMQP, they understand. If not, there are plentiful amounts of information available for research.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users configure a <em>broker</em>, instead of a pump.</p></li>
<li><p>By convention, the default vhost ‘/’ is always used (did not feel the need to use other vhosts yet)</p></li>
<li><p>Users explicitly can pick their <em>queue</em> names (this ia a client-id in MQTT.)</p></li>
<li><p>Users set <em>subtopic</em>,</p></li>
<li><p>Topics with dot separator are minimally transformed, rather than encoded.</p></li>
<li><p>Queue is set to <em>durable</em> so that notification messages are not lost across broker restarts.</p></li>
<li><p>We use <em>message headers</em> (AMQP-speak for key-value pairs) rather than encoding in JSON or some other payload format.</p></li>
<li><p><em>expire</em> how long to keep an idle queue or exchange around.</p></li>

<h3>MQTT (version =5) Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#mqtt-version-5-settings" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>MQTT is actually a better match to Sarracenia than AMQP, as it is entirely based on hierarchical topics. While topics are only one among a variety of choices for routing methods in AMQP.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>In MQTT, topic separator is / instead of .</p></li>
<li><p>The MQTT topic wildcard <em>#</em> is the same as in AMQP (match rest of topic)</p></li>
<li><p>The MQTT topic wildcard <em>+</em> is the same as the AMQP <em>*</em> (match one topic.)</p></li>
<li><p>An AMQP “Exchange” is mapped to the root of the MQTT topic tree,</p></li>
<li><p>An AMQP “queue” is represented in MQTT by <em>client-id</em> and a <em>shared subscription</em>. Note: Shared subscriptions are only present in MQTTv5.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AMQP: A queue named <em>queuename</em> is bound to an exchange xpublic with key: v03.observations …</p></li>
<li><p>MQTT subscription: topic $shared/<em>queuename</em>/xpublic/v03/observations …</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Connections are clean_sesssion=0 normally, to recover notification messages when a connection is broken.</p></li>
<li><p>MQTT QoS==1 is used to assure notification messages are sent at least once, and avoid overhead
of ensuring only once.</p></li>
<li><p>AMQP <em>prefetch</em> mapped to MQTT <em>receiveMaximum</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>expire</em> has same meaning in MQTT as in AMQP.</p></li>

<p>MQTT v3 lacks shared subscriptions, and the recovery logic is quite different. Sarracenia only supports v5.</p>

<p>A description of the conventional flow of notification messages through exchanges on a pump:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>subscribers usually bind to the xpublic exchange to get the main data feed. This is the default in a subscribe component.</p></li>
<li><p>A user will have two exchanges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>xs_user the exhange where the user posts their file notifications and report messages.</p></li>
<li><p>xr_user the exchange where the user reads their report messages from.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: “user” exchanges will be whichever username the user specified. Not explicitly “xs_user” or “xr_user”.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Usually the sarra component will read from xs_user, retrieve the data corresponding to the users <em>post</em> notification message, and then make it available on the pump, by re-announcing it on the xpublic exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrators will have access to a xreport exchange to get system-wide monitoring. The user will not have permission to do that, they can only look at xr_user, which will have the specific report messages for only the user.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these conventions is to encourage a reasonably secure means of operating. If a notification message is taken from xs_user, then the process doing the reading is responsible for ensuring that it is tagged as coming from the user on this cluster. This prevents certain types of ´spoofing´ as notification messages can only be posted by proper owners.</p>

<h2>Users and Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#users-and-roles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Usernames for pump authentication are significant in that they are visible to all. They are used in the directory path on public trees, as well as to authenticate to the broker. They need to be understandable. They are often wider scope than a person… perhaps call them ‘Accounts’. It can be elegant to configure the same usernames for use in transport engines.</p>
<p>All Account names should be unique, but nothing will avoid clashes when sources originate from different pump networks and clients at different destinations. In practice, name clashes are addressed by routing to avoid two different sources’ with the same name having their data offerings combined on a single tree. On the other hand, name clashes are not always an error. Use of a common source account name on different clusters may be used to implement folders that are shared between the two accounts with the same name.</p>
<p>Pump users are defined with the <em>declare</em> option. Each option starts with the <em>declare</em> keyword, followed by the specified role and lastly the user name which has that role.</p>
<p>Role can be one of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>subscriber</dt><dd><p>A subscriber is a user that can only subscribe to data and report messages. Not permitted to inject data. Each subscriber gets an xs_&lt;user&gt; named exchange on the pump. If a user is named <em>Acme</em>, the corresponding exchange will be <em>xs_Acme</em>. This exchange is where an sr_subscribe process will send its report messages.</p>
<p>By convention/default, the <em>anonymous</em> user is created on all pumps to permit subscription without a specific account.</p>
</dd>
<dt>source</dt><dd><p>A user permitted to subscribe or originate data. A source does not necessarily represent one person or type of data, but rather an organization responsible for the data produced. So if an organization gathers and makes available ten kinds of data with a single contact email or phone number for questions about the data and it’s availability, then all of those collection activities might use a single ‘source’ account.</p>
<p>Each source gets a xs_&lt;user&gt; exchange for injection of data notification messages and, similar to a subscriber, to send report messages about processing and receipt of data. Each source is able to view all of the notification messages for data it has injected, but the location where all of these notification messages are available varies according to administrator configuration of report routing. A source may inject data on a pump, but may subscribe to reports on a different pump. The reports corresponding to the data the source injected are written in exchange xr_&lt;user&gt;.</p>
<p>When data is first injected, the path is modified by sarracenia to prepend a fixed upper part of the directory tree. The first level directory is the day of ingest into the network in YYYYMMDD format. The second level directory is the source name. So for a user Alice, injecting data on May 4th, 2016, the root of the directory tree is: <cite>20160504/Alice</cite>. Note that all pumps are expected to run in the UTC timezone.</p>
<p>There are daily directories because there is a system-wide life-time for data, it is deleted after a standard number of days, data is just deleted from the root.</p>
<p>Since all clients will see the directories, and therefore client configurations will include them. It would be wise to consider the account name public, and relatively static.</p>
<p>Sources determine who can access their data, by specifying which cluster to send the data to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>feeder</dt><dd><p>A user permitted to subscribe or originate data, but understood to represent a pump. This local pump user would be used to run processes like sarra, report routing shovels, etc…</p>
</dd>
<dt>admin</dt><dd><p>A user permitted to manage the local pump. It is the real rabbitmq-server administrator. The administrator runs sr_audit to create/delete exchanges, users, or clean unused queues, etc.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example of a complete valid admin.conf, for a host named <em>blacklab</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>cluster blacklab
admin amqps://hbic&#64;blacklab/
feeder  amqps://feeder&#64;blacklab/
declare source goldenlab
declare subscriber anonymous</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A corresponding credentials.conf would look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">amqps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">hbic</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">hbicpw</span><span class="nd">@blacklab</span><span class="o">/</span>
<span class="n">amqps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">feeder</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">feederpw</span><span class="nd">@blacklab</span><span class="o">/</span>
<span class="n">amqps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">goldenlab</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">puppypw</span><span class="nd">@blacklab</span><span class="o">/</span>
<span class="n">amqps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">anonymous</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">anonymous</span><span class="nd">@blacklab</span><span class="o">/</span>
